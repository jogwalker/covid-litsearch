    <title>Comparison of Citations Trends between the COVID-19 Pandemic and
  SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, Avian and Swine Influenza Epidemics</title>
    <summary>  Objective: The novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak rapidly evolved into
pandemic. Global research efforts focus on this topic and with the
collaboration of the scientific journals publication industry produced more
than 16,000 related published articles in PubMed within five months from the
onset of the outbreak. Herein, a comparison of the COVID-19 citations in PubMed
and Web of Science was performed with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, avian
and swine influenza epidemics. Methods: The citations were searched and
collected using the disease terms and the date of publication restriction. The
total number of PubMed citations and the HIV associated papers during the same
chronological periods were examined in parallel. The journal category and
country information of the publications were gathered from Web of Science. The
collected data were statistically analyzed and compared. Results: Significant
correlations were found between COVID-19 and MERS (CC=0.988; p=0.003; q=0.006),
Ebola (CC=0.987; p=0.003; q=0.011), and SARS (CC=0.964; p=0.015; q=0.028)
epidemics five-month pick of novel citations in PubMed. However, COVID-19
publications were accumulated earlier and in larger numbers than any other 21st
century major communicable disease outbreak. Conclusion: The acceleration and
the total number of COVID-19 publications represent an unprecedented landmark
event in the medical library history. The immediate adoption of the fast-track
peer-reviewing and publishing as well as the open access publication policies
by the journal publishers are significant contributors to this bibliographic
phenomenon.

    <title>Epidemiological study of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <summary>  We report a statistical analysis of some highly infected countries by the
novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The cumulative infected data were fitted with
various growth models (e.g. Logistic equation, Weibull equation and Hill
equation) and obtained the power index of top ten highly infected countries.
The newly infected data were fitted with Gaussian distribution with the peak at
~40 days for the countries whose infection curves are seem to be saturated. The
similarity in growth kinetics of infected people of different countries
provides first-hand guidelines to take proper precautions to minimize human
damage.

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Classification using CT Images by Machine
  Learning Methods</title>
    <summary>  This study presents early phase detection of Coronavirus (COVID-19), which is
named by World Health Organization (WHO), by machine learning methods. The
detection process was implemented on abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) images.
The expert radiologists detected from CT images that COVID-19 shows different
behaviours from other viral pneumonia. Therefore, the clinical experts specify
that COV\.ID-19 virus needs to be diagnosed in early phase. For detection of
the COVID-19, four different datasets were formed by taking patches sized as
16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 from 150 CT images. The feature extraction process
was applied to patches to increase the classification performance. Grey Level
Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Directional Pattern (LDP), Grey Level Run
Length Matrix (GLRLM), Grey-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), and Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) algorithms were used as feature extraction methods.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) classified the extracted features. 2-fold, 5-fold
and 10-fold cross-validations were implemented during the classification
process. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score metrics
were used to evaluate the classification performance. The best classification
accuracy was obtained as 99.68% with 10-fold cross-validation and GLSZM feature
extraction method.

    <title>Ontology-based systematic classification and analysis of coronaviruses,
  hosts, and host-coronavirus interactions towards deep understanding of
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Given the existing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, it is critical to
systematically study the interactions between hosts and coronaviruses including
SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov, and SARS-CoV-2 (cause of COVID-19). We first created four
host-pathogen interaction (HPI)-Outcome postulates, and generated a HPI-Outcome
model as the basis for understanding host-coronavirus interactions (HCI) and
their relations with the disease outcomes. We hypothesized that ontology can be
used as an integrative platform to classify and analyze HCI and disease
outcomes. Accordingly, we annotated and categorized different coronaviruses,
hosts, and phenotypes using ontologies and identified their relations. Various
COVID-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused by the backend HCI
mechanisms. To further identify the causal HCI-outcome relations, we collected
35 experimentally-verified HCI protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and applied
literature mining to identify additional host PPIs in response to coronavirus
infections. The results were formulated in a logical ontology representation
for integrative HCI-outcome understanding. Using known PPIs as baits, we also
developed and applied a domain-inferred prediction method to predict new PPIs
and identified their pathological targets on multiple organs. Overall, our
proposed ontology-based integrative framework combined with computational
predictions can be used to support fundamental understanding of the intricate
interactions between human patients and coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2)
and their association with various disease outcomes.

    <title>A mathematical model for the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <summary>  A mathematical model is proposed for quantitative description of the outbreak
of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in China. Although the model is relatively
simple, the comparison with the public data shows that an exact solution
solution of the model (with the correctly-specified parameters) leads to the
results, which are in good agreement with the measured data. Prediction of the
total number of the COVID-19 cases is discussed and an example is presented
using the measured data in Austria.

    <title>Structural modeling of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) spike protein
  reveals a proteolytically-sensitive activation loop as a distinguishing
  feature compared to SARS-CoV and related SARS-like coronaviruses</title>
    <summary>  The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread
outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health
concern. Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and
SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with
SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike
glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization
between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity
in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended
structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor
binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be
proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and
entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that
the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability
and transmission.

    <title>Mining Coronavirus (COVID-19) Posts in Social Media</title>
    <summary>  World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) as a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020. Before this and in late
January, more specifically on January 27th, while the majority of the infection
cases were still reported in China and a few cruise ships, we began crawling
social media user postings using the Twitter search API. Our goal was to
leverage machine learning and linguistic tools to better understand the impact
of the outbreak in China. Unlike our initial expectation to monitor a local
outbreak, COVID-19 rapidly spread across the globe. In this short article we
report the preliminary results of our study on automatically detecting the
positive reports of COVID-19 from social media user postings using
state-of-the-art machine learning models.

    <title>Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Strike on Arab Countries and Territories: A
  Situation Report I</title>
    <summary>  The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new
virus called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV that first identified in Wuhan, China. The
disease causes respiratory illness (such as the flu) with other symptoms such
as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. This new
Coronavirus seems to be very infectious and has spread quickly and globally. In
this work, information about COVID-19 is provided and the situation in Arab
countries and territories regarding the COVID-19 strike is presented. The next
few weeks main expectations is also given.

    <title>Flight restrictions from China during the COVID-2019 Coronavirus
  outbreak</title>
    <summary>  This short note provides estimates of the number of passengers that travel
from China to all world airports in the period October 2019 - March 2020 on the
basis of historical data. From this baseline we subtract the expected reduction
in the number of passengers taking into account the temporary ban of some
routes which was put in place since 23 January 2020 following the COVID-2019
Coronavirus outbreak. The results indicate a reduction of the number of
passengers in the period January - March 2020 of -2.5%. This calculation
considers only the complete closure of routes (not just direct flights) and not
the reduction in the number of passengers on still active direct and indirect
connections. At the moment of writing, with such partial information it is
premature to quantify economic losses on the civil air transport and tourism
industry. This note is meant to provide a baseline that be extended to all
countries of origin and updated as more recent data will become available.

    <title>Particle modeling of the spreading of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)</title>
    <summary>  By the middle of May 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly five
million people and had spread to almost all countries worldwide. In response,
many countries all over the world have used different methods to reduce the
infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of schools and
universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social distancing,
including local and national lockdowns. In our work, we use a Monte-Carlo (MC)
based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population
densities using the most recent epidemic data. We test the spread of the
Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various
combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each
model and constraint. The main prediction of this model is that a cyclic
schedule of one week without restrictions and two weeks of lockdown can help to
control the virus infection. In particular, this model reduces the infection
rate when accompanied by social distancing and complete isolation of
symptomatic patients.

    <title>Coronavirus: Comparing COVID-19, SARS and MERS in the eyes of AI</title>
    <summary>  Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and quickly
spreading Coronavirus disease. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV,
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2011 and
current COVID-19 pandemic all from the same family of Coronavirus. The fatality
rate due to SARS and MERS were higher than COVID-19 however, the spread of
those were limited to few countries while COVID-19 affected more than
two-hundred countries of the world. In this work, authors used deep machine
learning algorithms along with innovative image pre-processing techniques to
distinguish COVID-19 images from SARS and MERS images. Several deep learning
algorithms were trained, and tested and four outperforming algorithms were
reported: SqueezeNet, ResNet18, Inceptionv3 and DenseNet201. Original, Contrast
limited adaptive histogram equalized and complemented image were used
individually and in concatenation as the inputs to the networks. It was
observed that inceptionv3 outperforms all networks for 3-channel concatenation
technique and provide an excellent sensitivity of 99.5%, 93.1% and 97% for
classifying COVID-19, MERS and SARS images respectively. Investigating deep
layer activation mapping of the correctly classified images and miss-classified
images, it was observed that some overlapping features between COVID-19 and
MERS images were identified by the deep layer network. Interestingly these
features were present in MERS images and 10 out of 144 images were
miss-classified as COVID while only one out of 423 COVID-19 images was
miss-classified as MERS. None of the MERS images was miss-classified to SARS
and only one COVID-19 image was miss-classified as SARS. Therefore, it can be
summarized that SARS images are significantly different from MERS and COVID-19
in the eyes of AI while there are some overlapping feature available between
MERS and COVID-19.

    <title>Day Level Forecasting for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Spread:
  Analysis, Modeling and Recommendations</title>
    <summary>  In mid of March 2020, Coronaviruses such as COVID-19 is declared as an
international epidemic. More than 125000 confirmed cases and 4,607 death cases
have been recorded around more than 118 countries. Unfortunately, a coronavirus
vaccine is expected to take at least 18 months if it works at all. Moreover,
COVID -19 epidemics can mutate into a more aggressive form. Day level
information about the COVID -19 spread is crucial to measure the behavior of
this new virus globally. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of day
level forecasting models on COVID-19 affected cases using time series models
and mathematical formulation. The forecasting models and data strongly suggest
that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do
not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and
closing of schools, universities, and workplaces (Social Distancing).

    <title>The socio-economic determinants of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
  pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The magnitude of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has an enormous
impact on the social life and the economic activities in almost every country
in the world. Besides the biological and epidemiological factors, a multitude
of social and economic criteria also govern the extent of the coronavirus
disease spread in the population. Consequently, there is an active debate
regarding the critical socio-economic determinants that contribute to the
resulting pandemic. In this paper, we contribute towards the resolution of the
debate by leveraging Bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data
to investigate the potential of 29 determinants, describing a diverse set of
socio-economic characteristics, in explaining the coronavirus pandemic outcome.
We show that the true empirical model behind the coronavirus outcome is
constituted only of few determinants, but the extent to which each determinant
is able to provide a credible explanation varies between countries due to their
heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics. To understand the relationship
between the potential determinants in the specification of the true model, we
develop the coronavirus determinants Jointness space. In this space, two
determinants are connected with each other if they are able to jointly explain
the coronavirus outcome. As constructed, the obtained map acts as a bridge
between theoretical investigations and empirical observations, and offers an
alternate view for the joint importance of the socio-economic determinants when
used for developing policies aimed at preventing future epidemic crises.

    <title>A Drone-based Networked System and Methods for Combating Coronavirus
  Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
discovered coronavirus. It is similar to influenza viruses and raises concerns
through alarming levels of spread and severity resulting in an ongoing pandemic
world-wide. Within five months (by May 2020), it infected 5.89 million persons
world-wide and over 357 thousand have died. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) are very helpful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This work
investigates the drone-based systems, COVID-19 pandemic situations, and
proposes architecture for handling pandemic situations in different scenarios
using real-time and simulation-based case studies. The proposed architecture
uses wearable sensors to record the observations in Body Area Networks (BANs)
in a push-pull data fetching mechanism. The proposed architecture is found to
be useful in remote and highly congested pandemic areas where either the
wireless or Internet connectivity is a major issue or chances of COVID-19
spreading are high. It collects and stores the substantial amount of data in a
stipulated period and helps to take appropriate action as and when required. In
real-time drone-based healthcare system implementation for COVID-19 operations,
it is observed that a large area can be covered for sanitization, thermal image
collection, patient identification etc. within a short period (2 KMs within 10
minutes approx.) through aerial route. In the simulation, the same statistics
are observed with an addition of collision-resistant strategies working
successfully for indoor and outdoor healthcare operations.

    <title>Assessing the Efficiency of Different Control Strategies for the
  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Epidemic</title>
    <summary>  The goal of this work is to analyse the effects of control policies for the
coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Brazil. This is done by considering an
age-structured SEIR model with a quarantine class and two types of controls.
The first one studies the sensitivity with regard to the parameters of the
basic reproductive number R0 which is calculated by the next generation method.
The second one evaluates different quarantine strategies by comparing their
relative total number of deaths.

    <title>A Novel AI-enabled Framework to Diagnose Coronavirus COVID 19 using
  Smartphone Embedded Sensors: Design Study</title>
    <summary>  Coronaviruses are a famous family of viruses that cause illness in both
humans and animals. The new type of coronavirus COVID-19 was firstly discovered
in Wuhan, China. However, recently, the virus has widely spread in most of the
world and causing a pandemic according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the
COVID-19. There are many mechanisms to detect coronavirus including clinical
analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed COVID-19
patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly, several
techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such as
medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost, taking
time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework is
proposed to detect COVID-19 using built-in smartphone sensors. The proposal
provides a low-cost solution, since most of radiologists have already held
smartphones for different daily-purposes. Not only that but also ordinary
people can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection
purposes. Nowadays Smartphones are powerful with existing computation-rich
processors, memory space, and large number of sensors including cameras,
microphone, temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour-sensor,
humidity-sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial
Intelligence (AI) enabled framework reads the smartphone sensors signal
measurements to predict the grade of severity of the pneumonia as well as
predicting the result of the disease.

    <title>Automatic Detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Using X-ray Images
  and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), with a starting point in China, has
spread rapidly among people living in other countries, and is approaching
approximately 305,275 cases worldwide according to the statistics of European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. There are a limited number of
COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the increasing cases daily.
Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a
quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people.
In this study, three different convolutional neural network based models
(ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the
detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patient using chest X-ray
radiographs. ROC analyses and confusion matrices by these three models are
given and analyzed using 5-fold cross validation. Considering the performance
results obtained, it is seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the
highest classification performance with 98% accuracy among other two proposed
models (97% accuracy for InceptionV3 and 87% accuracy for Inception-ResNetV2).

    <title>Spatiotemporal fluctuation scaling law and metapopulation modeling of
  the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks</title>
    <summary>  We comparatively analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the 2019-novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological
characteristics. Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to
characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001)
unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al.
(2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)]
to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL
analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific
heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for
cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections,
suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter
(M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds
(COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health
interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the
infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and
below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0
coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19
outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection
threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality
rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity
UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of
coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed
from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of
infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of
which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health
interventions.

    <title>A Mathematical Description of the Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease
  (COVID-19): A Case Study of Brazil</title>
    <summary>  This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and numerical simulations
related to the coronavirus dynamics. A description is developed based on the
framework of susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model. Initially, a model
verification is carried out calibrating system parameters with data from China,
Italy, Iran and Brazil. Afterward, numerical simulations are performed to
analyzed different scenarios of COVID-19 in Brazil. Results show the importance
of governmental and individual actions to control the number and the period of
the critical situations related to the pandemic.

    <title>SEI1I2HRSVM model applied to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in
  Paraguay</title>
    <summary>  In the present article a mathematical model is proposed to research the
current coronavirus outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) in Paraguay, describing the multiple
transmission paths in the infection dynamics, following the susceptible,
exposed, infectious, hospitalized, with lost immunity and recovered
individuals, as well as the role of the virus in the environment and deaths
from COVID-19 or other reasons. In order to reflect the impact of the control
measures adopted by the government and the population, the model employs
variable transmission rates that change with the epidemiological status and
environmental conditions. The model is validated, and its application is
demonstrated with data publicly available.

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19): ARIMA based time-series analysis to forecast
  near future</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, is currently a major worldwide threat. It has
infected more than a million people globally leading to hundred-thousands of
deaths. In such grave circumstances, it is very important to predict the future
infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the healthcare
service preparation. Following that notion, we have developed a model and then
employed it for forecasting future COVID-19 cases in India. The study indicates
an ascending trend for the cases in the coming days. A time series analysis
also presents an exponential increase in the number of cases. It is supposed
that the present prediction models will assist the government and medical
personnel to be prepared for the upcoming conditions and have more readiness in
healthcare systems.

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Classification using Deep Features Fusion and
  Ranking Technique</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged towards the end of 2019. World Health
Organization (WHO) was identified it as a global epidemic. Consensus occurred
in the opinion that using Computerized Tomography (CT) techniques for early
diagnosis of pandemic disease gives both fast and accurate results. It was
stated by expert radiologists that COVID-19 displays different behaviours in CT
images. In this study, a novel method was proposed as fusing and ranking deep
features to detect COVID-19 in early phase. 16x16 (Subset-1) and 32x32
(Subset-2) patches were obtained from 150 CT images to generate sub-datasets.
Within the scope of the proposed method, 3000 patch images have been labelled
as CoVID-19 and No finding for using in training and testing phase. Feature
fusion and ranking method have been applied in order to increase the
performance of the proposed method. Then, the processed data was classified
with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). According to other pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models used in transfer learning, the
proposed method shows high performance on Subset-2 with 98.27% accuracy, 98.93%
sensitivity, 97.60% specificity, 97.63% precision, 98.28% F1-score and 96.54%
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metrics.

    <title>Coronavirus research before 2020 is more relevant than ever, especially
  when interpreted for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The speed with which biomedical researchers were able to identify and
characterise COVID-19 was clearly due to prior research with other
coronaviruses. Early epidemiological comparisons with two previous
coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also made it easier to predict COVID-19's likely
spread and lethality. This article assesses whether academic interest in prior
coronavirus research has translated into interest in the primary source
material, using Mendeley reader counts for early academic impact evidence. The
results confirm that SARS and MERS research 2008-2017 experienced anomalously
high increases in Mendeley readers in April-May 2020. Nevertheless, studies
learning COVID-19 lessons from SARS and MERS or using them as a benchmark for
COVID-19 have generated much more academic interest than primary studies of
SARS or MERS. Thus, research that interprets prior relevant research for new
diseases when they are discovered seems to be particularly important to help
researchers to understand its implications in the new context.

    <title>BETS: The dangers of selection bias in early analyses of the coronavirus
  disease (COVID-19) pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly grown from a regional
outbreak in Wuhan, China to a global pandemic. Early estimates of the epidemic
growth and incubation period of COVID-19 may have been biased due to sample
selection. Using detailed case reports from 14 locations in and outside
mainland China, we obtained 378 Wuhan-exported cases who left Wuhan before an
abrupt travel quarantine. We developed a generative model we call BETS for four
key epidemiological events---Beginning of exposure, End of exposure, time of
Transmission, and time of Symptom onset (BETS)---and derived explicit formulas
to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why
some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic were
severely biased. All our analyses, regardless of which subsample and model were
being used, point to an epidemic doubling time of 2 to 2.5 days during the
early outbreak in Wuhan. A Bayesian nonparametric analysis further suggests
that about 5% of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within 14 days
of infection and that men may be much more likely than women to develop
symptoms within 2 days of infection.

    <title>Real-time forecasts and risk assessment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
  cases: A data-driven analysis</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency
of international concern affecting 201 countries and territories around the
globe. As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than
11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide.
The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time)
forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk
assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some
profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic
characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To
solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive
integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can
generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed
cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of
the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective
allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for
government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal
regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly
affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven
analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk
assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.

    <title>Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with Structured Latent
  Multi-View Representation Learning</title>
    <summary>  Recently, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread
rapidly across the world. Due to the large number of affected patients and
heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning
algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of
clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT)
has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In
this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of
features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features
describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is
learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of
features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability.
Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural
networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the
representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types
of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the
case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison
methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the numbers
of training data.

    <title>A Tale of Two Communities: Characterizing Reddit Response to COVID-19
  through /r/China_Flu and /r/Coronavirus</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted people's lives around the globe.
During the extended lockdowns caused by the pandemic, online communities are
crucial for people to access information and share experiences. In particular,
two "new" communities have emerged on Reddit: /r/China_flu and /r/Coronavirus.
By studying activities and users in these two communities, we provide a
characterization of people's responses to COVID-19 on Reddit. First, we find
that user activity peaks around March 17, when the World Health Organization
(WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic. Shortly after that, the activity levels
of both communities have been declining week by week. We further illustrate the
central role of these two communities in the emergence of COVID-related
communities. Second, we study the differences between these two communities.
/r/Coronavirus is recommended as the official community for COVID-19 on Reddit,
while /r/China_flu adopts a loose moderation practice. As a result, we observe
that these two communities are gradually growing apart and more extremism is
being found in /r/China_flu. Finally, we examine the spillover effect of the
COVID-19 pandemic on user activity across the entire Reddit platform. Our
results show significant changes in user activities outside COVID-related
communities. In subreddits related to finance, food, and countries/cities, user
activity is recovering to the pre-pandemic level in late April and May as
countries reopen, but subreddits related to travel and sports remain highly
impacted and show lower activity levels than the pre-pandemic period. Our work
highlights the strength of Reddit as a source for understanding public
reactions to COVID-19 and the importance of content moderation on the Internet
during a pandemic.

    <title>Estimating Uncertainty and Interpretability in Deep Learning for
  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Detection</title>
    <summary>  Deep Learning has achieved state of the art performance in medical imaging.
However, these methods for disease detection focus exclusively on improving the
accuracy of classification or predictions without quantifying uncertainty in a
decision. Knowing how much confidence there is in a computer-based medical
diagnosis is essential for gaining clinicians trust in the technology and
therefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
infections are a major healthcare challenge around the world. Detecting
COVID-19 in X-ray images is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and treatment.
However, diagnostic uncertainty in the report is a challenging and yet
inevitable task for radiologist. In this paper, we investigate how drop-weights
based Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) can estimate uncertainty in
Deep Learning solution to improve the diagnostic performance of the
human-machine team using publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and
show that the uncertainty in prediction is highly correlates with accuracy of
prediction. We believe that the availability of uncertainty-aware deep learning
solution will enable a wider adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a
clinical setting.

    <title>Quantitative assessment of the role of undocumented infection in the
  2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</title>
    <summary>  An urgent problem in controlling COVID-19 spreading is to understand the role
of undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking
into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters
determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using
data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is
capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of
confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The
drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different
countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as
the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the
occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating
its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that
insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented
infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that
country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model
predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did
not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is
that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a
non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been
deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently
imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving
into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting
the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the
hidden individuals.

    <title>Automatic Detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in X-ray and CT
  Images: A Machine Learning-Based Approach</title>
    <summary>  The newly identified Coronavirus pneumonia, subsequently termed COVID-19, is
highly transmittable and pathogenic with no clinically approved antiviral drug
or vaccine available for treatment. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are
dry cough, sore throat, and fever. Symptoms can progress to a severe form of
pneumonia with critical complications, including septic shock, pulmonary edema,
acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. While medical
imaging is not currently recommended in Canada for primary diagnosis of
COVID-19, computer-aided diagnosis systems could assist in the early detection
of COVID-19 abnormalities and help to monitor the progression of the disease,
potentially reduce mortality rates. In this study, we compare popular deep
learning-based feature extraction frameworks for automatic COVID-19
classification. To obtain the most accurate feature, which is an essential
component of learning, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, ResNet, InceptionV3,
InceptionResNetV2, VGGNet, NASNet were chosen amongst a pool of deep
convolutional neural networks. The extracted features were then fed into
several machine learning classifiers to classify subjects as either a case of
COVID-19 or a control. This approach avoided task-specific data pre-processing
methods to support a better generalization ability for unseen data. The
performance of the proposed method was validated on a publicly available
COVID-19 dataset of chest X-ray and CT images. The DenseNet121 feature
extractor with Bagging tree classifier achieved the best performance with 99%
classification accuracy. The second-best learner was a hybrid of the a ResNet50
feature extractor trained by LightGBM with an accuracy of 98%.

    <title>Mathematical Modeling of Epidemic Diseases; A Case Study of the COVID-19
  Coronavirus</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of the Coronavirus COVID-19 has taken the lives of several
thousands worldwide and locked-out many countries and regions, with yet
unpredictable global consequences. In this research we study the epidemic
patterns of this virus, from a mathematical modeling perspective. The study is
based on an extensions of the well-known susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
family of compartmental models. It is shown how social measures such as
distancing, regional lockdowns, quarantine and global public health vigilance,
influence the model parameters, which can eventually change the mortality rates
and active contaminated cases over time, in the real world. As with all
mathematical models, the predictive ability of the model is limited by the
accuracy of the available data and to the so-called level of abstraction used
for modeling the problem. In order to provide the broader audience of
researchers a better understanding of spreading patterns of epidemic diseases,
a short introduction on biological systems modeling is also presented and the
Matlab source codes for the simulations are provided online.

    <title>Tracking Social Media Discourse About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development
  of a Public Coronavirus Twitter Data Set</title>
    <summary>  At the time of this writing, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
outbreak has already put tremendous strain on many countries' citizens,
resources and economies around the world. Social distancing measures, travel
bans, self-quarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of
societies worldwide. With people forced out of public spaces, much conversation
about these phenomena now occurs online, e.g., on social media platforms like
Twitter. In this paper, we describe a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19)
Twitter dataset that we have been continuously collecting since January 22,
2020. We are making our dataset available to the research community
(https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs). It is our hope that our
contribution will enable the study of online conversation dynamics in the
context of a planetary-scale epidemic outbreak of unprecedented proportions and
implications. This dataset could also help track scientific coronavirus
misinformation and unverified rumors, or enable the understanding of fear and
panic -- and undoubtedly more. Ultimately, this dataset may contribute towards
enabling informed solutions and prescribing targeted policy interventions to
fight this global crisis.

    <title>Critical Impact of Social Networks Infodemic on Defeating Coronavirus
  COVID-19 Pandemic: Twitter-Based Study and Research Directions</title>
    <summary>  News creation and consumption has been changing since the advent of social
media. An estimated 2.95 billion people in 2019 used social media worldwide.
The widespread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 resulted with a tsunami of social
media. Most platforms were used to transmit relevant news, guidelines and
precautions to people. According to WHO, uncontrolled conspiracy theories and
propaganda are spreading faster than the COVID-19 pandemic itself, creating an
infodemic and thus causing psychological panic, misleading medical advises, and
economic disruption. Accordingly, discussions have been initiated with the
objective of moderating all COVID-19 communications, except those initiated
from trusted sources such as the WHO and authorized governmental entities. This
paper presents a large-scale study based on data mined from Twitter. Extensive
analysis has been performed on approximately one million COVID-19 related
tweets collected over a period of two months. Furthermore, the profiles of
288,000 users were analyzed including unique users profiles, meta-data and
tweets context. The study noted various interesting conclusions including the
critical impact of the (1) exploitation of the COVID-19 crisis to redirect
readers to irrelevant topics and (2) widespread of unauthentic medical
precautions and information. Further data analysis revealed the importance of
using social networks in a global pandemic crisis by relying on credible users
with variety of occupations, content developers and influencers in specific
fields. In this context, several insights and findings have been provided while
elaborating computing and non-computing implications and research directions
for potential solutions and social networks management strategies during crisis
periods.

    <title>Identification of Repurposal Drugs and Adverse Drug Reactions for
  Various Courses of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Based on Single-cell
  RNA Sequencing Data</title>
    <summary>  With more than 3.8 million people infected Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), poses a critical threat to human health. There is no proven
vaccine or specific drug to date, which highlights the urgent need for rapid
development of therapeutics for COVID-19. To identify potentially repurposable
drugs, we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA
approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the
gene expression perturbation data by chemicals from the Library of Integrated
Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project with publically available
single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from mild and severe COVID-19 patients. We
identified 281 FDA approved drugs that have the potential to be effective
against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 of which are currently undergoing clinical
trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. In conclusion, we have
identified a list of repurposable anti-SARS- CoV-2 drugs using a systems
biology approach.

    <title>Deep Sentiment Classification and Topic Discovery on Novel Coronavirus
  or COVID-19 Online Discussions: NLP Using LSTM Recurrent Neural Network
  Approach</title>
    <summary>  Internet forums and public social media, such as online healthcare forums,
provide a convenient channel for users (people/patients) concerned about health
issues to discuss and share information with each other. In late December 2019,
an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (infection from which results in the disease
named COVID-19) was reported, and, due to the rapid spread of the virus in
other parts of the world, the World Health Organization declared a state of
emergency. In this paper, we used automated extraction of COVID-19 related
discussions from social media and a natural language process (NLP) method based
on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID-19 from public
opinions. Moreover, we also investigate how to use LSTM recurrent neural
network for sentiment classification of COVID-19 comments. Our findings shed
light on the importance of using public opinions and suitable computational
techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and to guide related
decision-making.

    <title>Coronavirus and oil price crash</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus (COVID-19) creates fear and uncertainty, hitting the global
economy and amplifying the financial markets volatility. The oil price reaction
to COVID-19 was gradually accommodated until March 09, 2020, when, 49 days
after the release of the first coronavirus monitoring report by the World
Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia floods the market with oil. As a
result, international prices drop with more than 20% in one single day. Against
this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of
COVID-19 numbers on crude oil prices, while controlling for the impact of
financial volatility and the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty.
Our ARDL estimation shows that the COVID-19 daily reported cases of new
infections have a marginal negative impact on the crude oil prices in the long
run. Nevertheless, by amplifying the financial markets volatility, COVID-19
also has an indirect effect on the recent dynamics of crude oil prices.

    <title>Coronavirus Covid-19 spreading in Italy: optimizing an epidemiological
  model with dynamic social distancing through Differential Evolution</title>
    <summary>  The aim of this paper consists in the application of a recent epidemiological
model, namely SEIR with Social Distancing (SEIR--SD), extended here through the
definition of a social distancing function varying over time, to assess the
situation related to the spreading of the coronavirus Covid--19 in Italy and in
two of its most important regions, i.e., Lombardy and Campania. To profitably
use this model, the most suitable values of its parameters must be found. The
estimation of the SEIR--SD model parameters takes place here through the use of
Differential Evolution, a heuristic optimization technique. In this way, we are
able to evaluate for each of the three above-mentioned scenarios the daily
number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading, the
day(s) in which this number will be at its highest peak, and the day in which
the infected cases will become very close to zero.

    <title>Rapid AI Development Cycle for the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic:
  Initial Results for Automated Detection &amp; Patient Monitoring using Deep
  Learning CT Image Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Purpose: Develop AI-based automated CT image analysis tools for detection,
quantification, and tracking of Coronavirus; demonstrate they can differentiate
coronavirus patients from non-patients. Materials and Methods: Multiple
international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were
included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning
models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with
clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to
analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19
thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient
over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study
includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results:
Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT
studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and
infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2%
specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output
enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and
visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume
display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over
time. Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a
larger population, demonstrated that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis
can achieve high accuracy in detection of Coronavirus as well as quantification
and tracking of disease burden.

    <title>Harmony-Search and Otsu based System for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)
  Detection using Lung CT Scan Images</title>
    <summary>  Pneumonia is one of the foremost lung diseases and untreated pneumonia will
lead to serious threats for all age groups. The proposed work aims to extract
and evaluate the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused pneumonia infection in
lung using CT scans. We propose an image-assisted system to extract COVID-19
infected sections from lung CT scans (coronal view). It includes following
steps: (i) Threshold filter to extract the lung region by eliminating possible
artifacts; (ii) Image enhancement using Harmony-Search-Optimization and Otsu
thresholding; (iii) Image segmentation to extract infected region(s); and (iv)
Region-of-interest (ROI) extraction (features) from binary image to compute
level of severity. The features that are extracted from ROI are then employed
to identify the pixel ratio between the lung and infection sections to identify
infection level of severity. The primary objective of the tool is to assist the
pulmonologist not only to detect but also to help plan treatment process. As a
consequence, for mass screening processing, it will help prevent diagnostic
burden.

    <title>The Second Worldwide Wave of Interest in Coronavirus since the COVID-19
  Outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran: A Google Trends Study</title>
    <summary>  The recent emergence of a new coronavirus, COVID-19, has gained extensive
coverage in public media and global news. As of 24 March 2020, the virus has
caused viral pneumonia in tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, China, and
thousands of cases in 184 other countries and territories. This study explores
the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor worldwide interest in this
COVID-19 epidemic. GT was chosen as a source of reverse engineering data, given
the interest in the topic. Current data on COVID-19 is retrieved from (GT)
using one main search topic: Coronavirus. Geographical settings for GT are
worldwide, China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. The reported period is 15
January 2020 to 24 March 2020. The results show that the highest worldwide peak
in the first wave of demand for information was on 31 January 2020. After the
first peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second
wave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy,
with the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as
the first wave. The number of new cases reported daily is rising day by day.
This short communication gives a brief introduction to how the demand for
information on coronavirus epidemic is reported through GT.

    <title>Mutations on COVID-19 diagnostic targets</title>
    <summary>  Effective, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic reagents are of paramount
importance for combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic at a time there is no preventive vaccine nor specific drug available
for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It would be
an absolute tragedy if currently used diagnostic reagents are undermined in any
manner. Based on the genotyping of 7818 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples collected up
to May 1, 2020, we reveal that essentially all of the current COVID-19
diagnostic targets have had mutations. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 has the
most devastating mutations on the targets of various nucleocapsid (N) gene
primers and probes, which have been unfortunately used by countries around the
world to diagnose COVID-19. Our findings explain what has seriously gone wrong
with a specific diagnostic reagent made in China. To understand whether
SARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation ratio and
mutation $h$-index of all SARS-CoV genes, indicating that the N gene is the
most non-conservative gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings enable
researchers to target the most conservative SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins for
the design and development of COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, preventive
vaccines, and therapeutic medicines.

    <title>Repositioning of 8565 existing drugs for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected near 5 million
people and led to over 0.3 million deaths. Currently, there is no specific
anti-SARS-CoV-2 medication. New drug discovery typically takes more than ten
years. Drug repositioning becomes one of the most feasible approaches for
combating COVID-19. This work curates the largest available experimental
dataset for SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV main protease inhibitors. Based on this
dataset, we develop validated machine learning models with relatively low root
mean square error to screen 1553 FDA-approved drugs as well as other 7012
investigational or off-market drugs in DrugBank. We found that many existing
drugs might be potentially potent to SARS-CoV-2. The druggability of many
potent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors is analyzed. This work offers a
foundation for further experimental studies of COVID-19 drug repositioning.

    <title>How sustainable environments have reduced the diffusion of coronavirus
  disease 2019: the interaction between spread of COVID-19 infection, polluting
  industrialization, wind (renewable) energy</title>
    <summary>  This study endeavors to explain the relation between air pollution and
particulate compounds emissions, wind resources and energy, and the diffusion
of COVID-19 infection to provide insights of sustainable policy to prevent
future epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy,
one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and
deaths. Results reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind
speed and a high wind energy production in MW have a lower number of infected
individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in
hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high
polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less cleaner production have a
greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with
pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low
wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the
air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence
of viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus
disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection cannot be solved
only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but
also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable
development. Overall, then, this study has to conclude that a strategy to
prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on
sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and
cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the
factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in
society.

    <title>Power of Artificial Intelligence to Diagnose and Prevent Further
  COVID-19 Outbreak: A Short Communication</title>
    <summary>  Novel coronavirus-19 (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) is by far the most dangerous
coronavirus ever identified for the third time in the three decades capable of
infecting not only the animals but also the humans across the globe. Nearly
6000 deaths have been recorded due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and
more than 50% of these deaths appeared to have evolved from China where the
virus was thought to originate. The endemicity of COVID-19 dramatically
surpassed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were so far discovered in
2003 and 2012 respectively. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak not only a public health emergency but also
pandemic in nature. Currently, over 120 countries including Nigeria were
reported to have more than 157,844 confirmed cases and 5,846 deaths due mainly
to COVID-19 outbreak as of March 15, 2020, 10:55 GMT. Artificial Intelligence
(AI) is widely used to aid in the prediction, detection, response, recovery of
disease and making clinical diagnosis. In this study, we highlighted the power
of AI in the containment and mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 outbreak in
African countries such as Nigeria where human to human contact is apparently
inevitable.

    <title>Review of COVID-19 Antibody Therapies</title>
    <summary>  Under the global health emergency caused by coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), efficient and specific therapies are urgently needed. Compared with
traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to
develop and as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and thus attract much attention in the
past few months. This work reviews seven existing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2
spike (S) protein with three-dimensional (3D) structures deposited in the
Protein Data Bank. Five antibody structures associated with SARS-CoV are
evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of
these antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are compared
with those of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and RBD complexes. Due to
the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding
affinities, we introduce topological data analysis (TDA), a variety of network
models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic
potential of the aforementioned fourteen antibody-antigen complexes. The
current COVID-19 antibody clinical trials, which are not limited to the S
protein target, are also reviewed.

    <title>Distant sequence similarity between hepcidin and the novel coronavirus
  spike glycoprotein: a potential hint at the possibility of local iron
  dysregulation in COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has
attracted attention for its vaccine potential and binding capacity to host cell
surface receptors. Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomain
of the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region,
followed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similarity
between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and
the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is
thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication of
this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation
in the coronavirus research field making use of an already-established
literature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation,
cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, respiratory infections and the
hepcidin protein. The question of possible homology and an evolutionary
connection between the viral spike protein and hepcidin is not assessed in this
report, but some scenarios for its study are discussed.

    <title>COVIDX-Net: A Framework of Deep Learning Classifiers to Diagnose
  COVID-19 in X-Ray Images</title>
    <summary>  Background and Purpose: Coronaviruses (CoV) are perilous viruses that may
cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was
discovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the end
of 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of
infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the
updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of
this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net
to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.
Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study
is validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19
cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep
convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group
Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural
network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image
to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case.
Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully
done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases,
respectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models
showed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with
f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to
classify COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework.
Clinical studies are the next milestone of this research work.

    <title>Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm: A bioinspired metaheuristic based on
  the COVID-19 propagation model</title>
    <summary>  A novel bioinspired metaheuristic is proposed in this work, simulating how
the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people. From an initial individual
(the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates,
creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or
infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms
such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are
introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the
coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major
advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters
are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers
from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the
ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either.
Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some
iterations, when considering social isolation measures and the high number
recovered and dead people, the number of infected people starts decreasing in
subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a parallel multi-virus version is proposed
in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search
space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined
with deep learning models, in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the
training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time
series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance.

    <title>Repurpose Open Data to Discover Therapeutics for COVID-19 using Deep
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  There have been more than 850,000 confirmed cases and over 48,000 deaths from
the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by novel severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in the United States
alone. However, there are currently no proven effective medications against
COVID-19. Drug repurposing offers a promising way for the development of
prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19. This study reports an
integrative, network-based deep learning methodology to identify repurposable
drugs for COVID-19 (termed CoV-KGE). Specifically, we built a comprehensive
knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships
connecting drugs, diseases, genes, pathways, and expressions, from a large
scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Using Amazon AWS computing
resources, we identified 41 repurposable drugs (including indomethacin,
toremifene and niclosamide) whose therapeutic association with COVID-19 were
validated by transcriptomic and proteomic data in SARS-CoV-2 infected human
cells and data from ongoing clinical trials. While this study, by no means
recommends specific drugs, it demonstrates a powerful deep learning methodology
to prioritize existing drugs for further investigation, which holds the
potential of accelerating therapeutic development for COVID-19.

    <title>Detection of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Associated Pneumonia based on
  Generative Adversarial Networks and a Fine-Tuned Deep Transfer Learning Model
  using Chest X-ray Dataset</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the devastating viruses according to the
world health organization. This novel virus leads to pneumonia, which is an
infection that inflames the lungs' air sacs of a human. One of the methods to
detect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a
pneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN)
with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be
presented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and
made it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images
from the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray
images with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10%
of the dataset for training data and generates 90% of images using GAN to prove
the efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet,
Squeeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect
the pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small
number of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the
complexity of the models and the consumed memory and time. Using a combination
of GAN and deep transfer models proved it is efficiency according to testing
accuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most
appropriate deep transfer model according to testing accuracy measurement and
achieved 99% with the other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and
F1 score while using GAN as an image augmenter. Finally, a comparison result
was carried out at the end of the research with related work which used the
same dataset except that this research used only 10% of original dataset. The
presented work achieved a superior result than the related work in terms of
testing accuracy.

    <title>Detecting fake news for the new coronavirus by reasoning on the Covid-19
  ontology</title>
    <summary>  In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, many were quick to spread deceptive
information. I investigate here how reasoning in Description Logics (DLs) can
detect inconsistencies between trusted medical sources and not trusted ones.
The not-trusted information comes in natural language (e.g. "Covid-19 affects
only the elderly"). To automatically convert into DLs, I used the FRED
converter. Reasoning in Description Logics is then performed with the Racer
tool.

    <title>Statistical investigation of relationship between spread of coronavirus
  disease (COVID-19) and environmental factors based on study of four mostly
  affected places of China and five mostly affected places of Italy</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus disease which is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It originated in China in the
month of December 2019 and quickly started to spread within the country. On
31st December 2019, it was first reported to country office of World Health
Organization (WHO) in China. Since then, it has spread to most of the countries
around the globe. However, there has been a recent rise in trend in believing
that it would go away during summer days, which has not yet been properly
investigated. In this paper, relationship of daily number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 with three environmental factors, viz. maximum relative humidity
(RH_max), maximum temperature (T_max) and highest wind speed (WS_max),
considering the incubation period, have been investigated statistically, for
four of the most affected places of China, viz. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai,
Wuhan and five of the most affected places of Italy, viz. Bergamo, Cremona,
Lodi, Milano. It has been found that the relationship with maximum relative
humidity and highest wind is mostly negligible, whereas relationship with
maximum temperature is ranging between negligible to moderate.

    <title>Prediction and analysis of Coronavirus Disease 2019</title>
    <summary>  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was found in a seafood wholesale market
in Wuhan, China. WHO officially named this coronavirus as COVID-19. Since the
first patient was hospitalized on December 12, 2019, China has reported a total
of 78,824 confirmed CONID-19 cases and 2,788 deaths as of February 28, 2020.
Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of
the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic
prevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have
reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19
epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic
development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e.,
Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of
SARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the
existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the
situation of COVID-19. The prediction results of three different mathematical
models are different for different parameters and in different regions. In
general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three
models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be
better than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the
three models, the total number of people expected to be infected is 49852-57447
in Wuhan,12972-13405 in non-Hubei areas and 80261-85140 in China respectively.
The total death toll is 2502-5108 in Wuhan, 107-125 in Non-Hubei areas and
3150-6286 in China respetively. COVID-19 will be over p robably in late-April,
2020 in Wuhan and before late-March, 2020 in other areas respectively.

    <title>Severity Assessment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Using
  Quantitative Features from Chest CT Images</title>
    <summary>  Background: Chest computed tomography (CT) is recognized as an important tool
for COVID-19 severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase
rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may
lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize
automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest
CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting
assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age
45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,
from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the
whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are
calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity
(non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each
quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of
COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross
validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive
rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of
quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the
whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to
the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the
right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left
lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment
(non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.
Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity
of COVID-19, were revealed.

    <title>Comparing the binding interactions in the receptor binding domains of
  SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19, since emerged in Wuhan, China, has been a major concern due to its
high infection rate, leaving more than one million infected people around the
world. Huge number of studies tried to reveal the structure of the SARS-CoV-2
compared to the SARS-CoV-1, in order to suppress this high infection rate. Some
of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein
might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor.
In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling
to compare the binding affinities of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 stronger
than SARS-CoV by 7 kcal/mol, due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. The
major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies are resulting from
the salt-bridges formed between R426 and ACE2-E329 in case of SARS-CoV and K417
and ACE2-D30 for SARS-CoV2. In addition, there is no significant contribution
from a single mutant to the binding energies. However, these mutations induce
sophisticated structural changes that enhance the binding energies. Our results
also indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely a lab engineered virus.

    <title>Genotyping coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: methods and implications</title>
    <summary>  The emerging global infectious COVID-19 coronavirus disease by novel Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats
to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late
December 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways of
evolution. For understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,
genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accurate
method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes.
The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard
distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis
of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations
are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method
serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic
viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis
shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase,
and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for
vaccine development in disease control.

    <title>Assessment of the MERS-CoV epidemic situation in the Middle East region</title>
    <summary>  The appearance of a novel coronavirus named Middle East (ME) Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has raised global public health concerns
regarding the current situation and its future evolution. Here we propose an
integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME region
and importations in Europe to assess transmission scenario and incidence of
sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model
integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the
zoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood
estimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic
(R=0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.77) associated with a 0.28 (95% CI
0.12-0.85) daily rate of sporadic introductions. Infections in the region
appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with
possible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in
the range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of
flight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of
importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security,
this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates,
suggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for
increased alertness in high-risk areas worldwide.

    <title>SAveRUNNER: a network-based algorithm for drug repurposing and its
  application to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The novelty of new human coronavirus COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of
effective drugs and vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed
to fight this worldwide pandemic. Many of these strategies rely on the
repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost
compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a new
network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching
off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by
quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific
proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure
that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same
network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14
selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing
genes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic
similarity, comorbidity, or for their association to drugs tentatively
repurposed to treat COVID-19. Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we
identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label
drugs for COVID-19 treatments, as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs,
actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of
putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential
anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity
values. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,
and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by
performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the
network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect
against human coronavirus infections.

    <title>Modelling and predicting the spatio-temporal spread of Coronavirus
  disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy</title>
    <summary>  Official freely available data about the number of infected at the finest
possible level of spatial areal aggregation (Italian provinces) are used to
model the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level.
Data time horizon ranges from 26 February 20020, which is the date when the
first case not directly connected with China has been discovered in northern
Italy, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series
mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been
implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the
phenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide
reliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three
subcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the
evolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission
of the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the
effects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of
nearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in
Italy, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on
the others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an
error of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level,
instead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces
first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the
effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are
currently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the
spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent. Moreover, the proposed
model provides good forecasts of the number of infections at local level while
controlling for delayed reporting.

    <title>Metapopulation network models for understanding, predicting and managing
  the coronavirus disease COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 spread are used for guiding the design of
mitigation steps aimed at containing and decelerating the contagion, and at
identifying impending breaches of health care system surge capacity. The
challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections are
compounded by the geographic heterogeneity of the population. To address this
problem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban
settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the
pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models. The
setting of the model parameters takes into account the fact that SARS-CoV-2
transmission occurs mostly via human-to-human contact, and that the frequency
of contact among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may
change over time. Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an
uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other
communities where the infection is present. To account for these important
aspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact
between its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes. Census
and cell phone data can be used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network,
which can, in turn, be modified to account for different levels of mitigation
measures. In order to make the network SEIR model that we propose easy to
customize, it is formulated in terms of easily interpretable parameters that
can be estimated from available community level data. The models parameters are
estimated with Bayesian techniques using COVID-19 data for the states of Ohio
and Michigan. The network model also gives rise to a geographically distributed
computational model that explains the geographic dynamics of the contagion,
e.g., in larger cities surrounded by suburban and rural areas.

approximately 197,188 confirmed cases of which 80,881 are in "Mainland China"
with 7,949 deaths, a mortality rate of 3.4%. In order to support radiologists
in this overwhelming challenge, we develop a deep learning based algorithm that
can detect, localize and quantify severity of COVID-19 manifestation from chest
CT scans. The algorithm is comprised of a pipeline of image processing
algorithms which includes lung segmentation, 2D slice classification and fine
grain localization. In order to further understand the manifestations of the
disease, we perform unsupervised clustering of abnormal slices. We present our
results on a dataset comprised of 110 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Zhejiang
province, China.

    <title>Molecular docking and binding mode analysis of selected FDA approved
  drugs against COVID-19 selected key protein targets: An effort towards drug
  repurposing to identify the combination therapy to combat COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of COVID-19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral
and antibiotic drugs. Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure
rate, high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of
new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing
also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a
new application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the
current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA
approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative
viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, many
existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to SARS-CoV and
likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected three viral key
proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry
into the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion
from immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to
combat COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the
binding affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues
playing a key role in their mechanism of action. The docking studies were
carried out through Autodock and online COVID-19 docking server. Further
studies on a broad range of FDA approved drugs including few more protein
targets, molecular dynamics studies, in-vitro and in-vivo biological evaluation
are required to identify the combination therapy targeting various stages of
the viral life cycle.

    <title>Visualising COVID-19 Research</title>
    <summary>  The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a
new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically
changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly
to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments,
scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources
available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories,
to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this
paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining
advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend
analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for
quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two
recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the
Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information
including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain
initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical
topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories
through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and
automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our
methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery
systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid
scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues
in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Morphology and numerical characteristics of epidemic curves for
  SARS-Cov-II using Moyal distribution</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, it is shown that the Moyal distribution is an excelent tool to
study the SARS-Cov-II (Covid-19) epidemiological associated curves and its
propagation. The Moyal parameters give all the information to describe the form
and the impact of the illness outbreak in the different affected countries and
its global impact. We checked that the Moyal distribution can accurately fit
the daily report of {\it{new confirmed cases of infected people}} (NCC) per
country, in that places where the contagion is reaching their final phase,
describing the beginning, the most intense phase and the descend of the
contagion, simultaneously . In order to achieve the purpose of this work, it is
important to work with a complete and well compilated set of the data to be
used to fit the curves. Data from European countries like France, Spain, Italy
Belgium, Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark and others like USA and China, have
been used. Also, the correlation between the parameters of the Moyal
distribution fitting and the general public health measures imposed in each
country, have been discussed. A relation between those policies and the
features of the Moyal distribution, in terms of their parameters and critical
points, is shown; from that, it can be seen that the knowledge of the time
evolution of the epidemiological curve, their critical points, superposition
properties and rates of the rising and the ending, could help to find a way to
estimate the efficiency of social distancing measures, imposed in each country,
and anticipate the different phases of the pandemic.

    <title>Dinucleotide repeats in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome: evolutionary
  implications</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing global pandemic of infection disease COVID-19 caused by the 2019
novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2, formerly 2019-nCoV) presents critical threats to
public health and the economy since it was identified in China, December 2019.
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 had been sequenced and structurally annotated, yet
little is known of the intrinsic organization and evolution of the genome. To
this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of
barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is
constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides, and
therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results
demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits dinucleotide TT islands in the
non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the dinucleotide
regions suggests that the dinucleotide repeats are increased during evolution
and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus. The special dinucleotide
regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome identified in this study may become diagnostic
and pharmaceutical targets in monitoring and curing the COVID-19 disease.

    <title>Advertisers Jump on Coronavirus Bandwagon: Politics, News, and Business</title>
    <summary>  In the age of social media, disasters and epidemics usher not only a
devastation and affliction in the physical world, but also prompt a deluge of
information, opinions, prognoses and advice to billions of internet users. The
coronavirus epidemic of 2019-2020, or COVID-19, is no exception, with the World
Health Organization warning of a possible "infodemic" of fake news. In this
study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak
through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform
in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from
public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media,
politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and
agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations,
business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among
these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from
bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians. As we
make the dataset available to the community, we hope the advertising domain
will become an important part of quality control for public health
communication and public discourse in general.

    <title>COVID-19 Docking Server: An interactive server for docking small
  molecules, peptides and antibodies against potential targets of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a new type of coronavirus
has been emerging from China and led to thousands of death globally since
December 2019. Despite many groups have engaged in studying the newly emerged
virus and searching for the treatment of COVID-19, the understanding of the
COVID-19 target -ligand interactions represents a key challenge. Herein, we
introduce COVID-19 Docking Server, a web server that predicts the binding modes
between COVID-19 targets and the ligands including small molecules, peptide and
antibody. Structures of proteins involved in the virus life cycle were
collected or constructed based on the homologs of coronavirus, and prepared
ready for docking. The platform provides a free and interactive tool for the
prediction of COVID-19 target-ligand interactions and following drug discovery
for COVID-19.

    <title>NAIST COVID: Multilingual COVID-19 Twitter and Weibo Dataset</title>
    <summary>  Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the late 2019,
it has affected over 200 countries and billions of people worldwide. This has
affected the social life of people owing to enforcements, such as "social
distancing" and "stay at home." This has resulted in an increasing interaction
through social media. Given that social media can bring us valuable information
about COVID-19 at a global scale, it is important to share the data and
encourage social media studies against COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.
Therefore, we have released a multilingual dataset of social media posts
related to COVID-19, consisting of microblogs in English and Japanese from
Twitter and those in Chinese from Weibo. The data cover microblogs from January
20, 2020, to March 24, 2020. This paper also provides a quantitative as well as
qualitative analysis of these datasets by creating daily word clouds as an
example of text-mining analysis. The dataset is now available on Github. This
dataset can be analyzed in a multitude of ways and is expected to help in
efficient communication of precautions related to COVID-19.

    <title>Disinformation and Misinformation on Twitter during the Novel
  Coronavirus Outbreak</title>
    <summary>  As the novel coronavirus spread globally, a growing public panic was
expressed over the internet. We examine the public discussion concerning
COVID-19 on Twitter. We use a dataset of 67 million tweets from 12 million
users collected between January 29, 2020 and March 4, 2020. We categorize users
based on their home countries, social identities, and political orientation. We
find that news media, government officials, and individual news reporters
posted a majority of influential tweets, while the most influential ones are
still written by regular users. Tweets mentioning "fake news" URLs and
disinformation story-lines are also more likely to be spread by regular users.
Unlike real news and normal tweets, tweets containing URLs pointing to "fake
news" sites are most likely to be retweeted within the source country and so
are less likely to spread internationally.

    <title>Beyond the Virus: A First Look at Coronavirus-themed Mobile Malware</title>
    <summary>  As the COVID-19 pandemic emerges in early 2020, a number of campaigns have
started capitalizing the topic. Although a few media reports mentioned the
existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks
the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware,
and there is no publicly accessible dataset that could be utilized to boost the
related research. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of
coronavirus-themed mobile malware. We first make efforts to create a daily
growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains $2,016$ COVID-19
themed apps and $277$ malware samples by the time of May 26, 2020. We then
present an analysis of these apps from multiple perspectives including
popularity and trends, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious
campaigns. We observe that the growth of the number of COVID-19 themed apps is
highly related to the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world. Most
of them were released through distribution channels beyond app markets. A
majority of the malicious apps (over 53%) are camouflaged as official apps
using the same app identifiers and some of them use confusing similar app icons
with the official ones to mislead users. Their main purposes are either
stealing users' private information or making profit by using the tricks like
phishing and extortion. Furthermore, we find that only 40\% of the COVID-19
malware creators are habitual developers who are active for a long time, while
60\% of them are new emerging ones in this pandemic and only released COVID-19
themed malware. The malicious developers are mainly located in US, mostly
targeting countries including English countries, Arabic countries, Europe and
China. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all the
well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community.

    <title>#Coronavirus or #Chinesevirus?!: Understanding the negative sentiment
  reflected in Tweets with racist hashtags across the development of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Situated in the global outbreak of COVID-19, our study enriches the
discussion concerning the emergent racism and xenophobia on social media. With
big data extracted from Twitter, we focus on the analysis of negative sentiment
reflected in tweets marked with racist hashtags, as racism and xenophobia are
more likely to be delivered via the negative sentiment. Especially, we propose
a stage-based approach to capture how the negative sentiment changes along with
the three development stages of COVID-19, under which it transformed from a
domestic epidemic into an international public health emergency and later, into
the global pandemic. At each stage, sentiment analysis enables us to recognize
the negative sentiment from tweets with racist hashtags, and keyword extraction
allows for the discovery of themes in the expression of negative sentiment by
these tweets. Under this public health crisis of human beings, this stage-based
approach enables us to provide policy suggestions for the enactment of
stage-specific intervention strategies to combat racism and xenophobia on
social media in a more effective way.

    <title>Time Varying Markov Process with Partially Observed Aggregate Data; An
  Application to Coronavirus</title>
    <summary>  A major difficulty in the analysis of propagation of the coronavirus is that
many infected individuals show no symptoms of Covid-19. This implies a lack of
information on the total counts of infected individuals and of recovered and
immunized individuals. In this paper, we consider parametric time varying
Markov processes of Coronavirus propagation and show how to estimate the model
parameters and approximate the unobserved counts from daily numbers of infected
and detected individuals and total daily death counts. This model-based
approach is illustrated in an application to French data.

    <title>Infodemiological Study Using Google Trends on Coronavirus Epidemic in
  Wuhan, China</title>
    <summary>  The recent emergence of a new coronavirus (COVID-19) has gained a high cover
in public media and worldwide news. The virus has caused a viral pneumonia in
tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, a central city of China. This short paper
gives a brief introduction on how the demand for information on this new
epidemic is reported through Google Trends. The reported period is 31 December
2020 to 20 March 2020. The authors draw conclusions on current infodemiological
data on COVID-19 using three main search keywords: coronavirus, SARS and MERS.
Two approaches are set. First is the worldwide perspective, second - the
Chinese one, which reveals that in China this disease in the first days was
more often referred to SARS then to general coronaviruses, whereas worldwide,
since the beginning, it is more often referred to coronaviruses.

    <title>CORD-19: The Covid-19 Open Research Dataset</title>
    <summary>  The Covid-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a growing resource of
scientific papers on Covid-19 and related historical coronavirus research.
CORD-19 is designed to facilitate the development of text mining and
information retrieval systems over its rich collection of metadata and
structured full text papers. Since its release, CORD-19 has been downloaded
over 75K times and has served as the basis of many Covid-19 text mining and
discovery systems. In this article, we describe the mechanics of dataset
construction, highlighting challenges and key design decisions, provide an
overview of how CORD-19 has been used, and preview tools and upcoming shared
tasks built around the dataset. We hope this resource will continue to bring
together the computing community, biomedical experts, and policy makers in the
search for effective treatments and management policies for Covid-19.

    <title>Estimating and Projecting Air Passenger Traffic during the COVID-19
  Coronavirus Outbreak and its Socio-Economic Impact</title>
    <summary>  The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers
traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the
aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019,
a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making
use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and
on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent
changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its
socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis
and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to this
hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation
losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to
the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss
could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30
millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of
2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case
scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run
and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban.

    <title>Mobility Changes in Response to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, both voluntary changes in behavior and
administrative restrictions on human interactions have occurred. These actions
are intended to reduce the transmission rate of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We use anonymized and/or de-identified
mobile device locations to measure mobility, a statistic representing the
distance a typical member of a given population moves in a day. Results
indicate that a large reduction in mobility has taken place, both in the US and
globally. In the United States, large mobility reductions have been detected
associated with the onset of the COVID-19 threat and specific government
directives. Mobility data at the US admin1 (state) and admin2 (county) level

    <title>COVIDGR dataset and COVID-SDNet methodology for predicting COVID-19
  based on Chest X-Ray images</title>
    <summary>  Currently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), one of the most infectious
diseases in the 21st century, is diagnosed using RT-PCR testing, CT scans
and/or Chest X-Ray (CXR) images. CT (Computed Tomography) scanners and RT-PCR
testing are not available in most medical centers and hence in many cases CXR
images become the most time/cost effective tool for assisting clinicians in
making decisions. Deep learning neural networks have a great potential for
building triage systems for detecting COVID-19 patients, especially patients
with low severity. Unfortunately, current databases do not allow building such
systems as they are highly heterogeneous and biased towards severe cases. This
paper is three-fold: (i) we demystify the high sensitivities achieved by most
recent COVID-19 classification models, (ii) under a close collaboration with
Hospital Universitario Cl\'inico San Cecilio, Granada, Spain, we built
COVIDGR-1.0, a homogeneous and balanced database that includes all levels of
severity, from Normal with positive RT-PCR, Mild, Moderate to Severe.
COVIDGR-1.0 contains 377 positive and 377 negative PA (PosteroAnterior) CXR
views and (iii) we propose COVID Smart Data based Network (COVID-SDNet)
methodology for improving the generalization capacity of COVID-classification
models. Our approach reaches good and stable results with an accuracy of
$97.37\% \pm 1.86 \%$, $88.14\% \pm 2.02\%$, $66.5\% \pm 8.04\%$ in severe,
moderate and mild COVID severity levels. Our approach could help in the early
detection of COVID-19. COVIDGR-1.0 dataset will be made available after the
review process.

    <title>Hi Sigma, do I have the Coronavirus?: Call for a New Artificial
  Intelligence Approach to Support Health Care Professionals Dealing With The
  COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Just like your phone can detect what song is playing in crowded spaces, we
show that Artificial Intelligence transfer learning algorithms trained on cough
phone recordings results in diagnostic tests for COVID-19. To gain adoption by
the health care community, we plan to validate our results in a clinical trial
and three other venues in Mexico, Spain and the USA . However, if we had data
from other on-going clinical trials and volunteers, we may do much more. For
example, for confirmed stay-at-home COVID-19 patients, a longitudinal audio
test could be developed to determine contact-with-hospital recommendations, and
for the most critical COVID-19 patients a success ratio forecast test,
including patient clinical data, to prioritize ICU allocation. As a challenge
to the engineering community and in the context of our clinical trial, the
authors suggest distributing cough recordings daily, hoping other trials and
crowdsourcing users will contribute more data. Previous approaches to complex
AI tasks have either used a static dataset or were private efforts led by large
corporations. All existing COVID-19 trials published also follow this paradigm.
Instead, we suggest a novel open collective approach to large-scale real-time
health care AI. We will be posting updates at https://opensigma.mit.edu. Our
personal view is that our approach is the right one for large scale pandemics,
and therefore is here to stay - will you join?

    <title>Towards Characterizing COVID-19 Awareness on Twitter</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly altered our lifestyles
as we resort to minimize the spread through preventive measures such as social
distancing and quarantine. An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between
the exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures.
This gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its
preventive measures. Nowadays, social media platforms (ie., Twitter) are
frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In
this paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19
by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that,
we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most
affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related
trends, 2) the volume of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3)
the user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries
with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to
expedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also
observed that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated
before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive
attempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in
countries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19
preventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social
media usage can influence public behavior, which can be leveraged to better
combat future pandemics.

    <title>COVID-19 Blockchain Framework: Innovative Approach</title>
    <summary>  The world is currently witnessing dangerous shifts in the epidemic of
emerging SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of (COVID-19) coronavirus. The
infection, and death numbers reported by World Health Organization (WHO) about
this epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people and the
economics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are
currently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown
infected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to
mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for
mitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion.
This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the
possibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage
advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the
unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will
enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within
conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of
P2P-Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an
effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens
to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection
prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed
and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier
Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance
System. This four components work together for detecting the unknown infected
cases and predicting and estimating the infection Risk of Corona Virus
(COVID-19).

    <title>A First Instagram Dataset on COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak is drastically shaping and
reshaping many aspects of our life, with a huge impact on our social life. In
this era of lockdown policies in most of the major cities around the world, we
see a huge increase in people and professional engagement in social media.
Social media is playing an important role in news propagation as well as
keeping people in contact. At the same time, this source is both a blessing and
a curse as the coronavirus infodemic has become a major concern, and is already
a topic that needs special attention and further research. In this paper, we
provide a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Instagram dataset that we have
been continuously collected since March 30, 2020. We are making our dataset
available to the research community at Github. We believe that this
contribution will help the community to better understand the dynamics behind
this phenomenon in Instagram, as one of the major social media. This dataset
could also help study the propagation of misinformation related to this
outbreak.

    <title>Identifying Radiological Findings Related to COVID-19 from Medical
  Literature</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than one million
individuals all over the world and caused more than 55,000 deaths, as of April
3 in 2020. Radiological findings are important sources of information in
guiding the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. However, the existing studies
on how radiological findings are correlated with COVID-19 are conducted
separately by different hospitals, which may be inconsistent or even
conflicting due to population bias. To address this problem, we develop natural
language processing methods to analyze a large collection of COVID-19
literature containing study reports from hospitals all over the world,
reconcile these results, and draw unbiased and universally-sensible conclusions
about the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19. We apply our
method to the CORD-19 dataset and successfully extract a set of radiological
findings that are closely tied to COVID-19.

    <title>SLEDGE: A Simple Yet Effective Baseline for Coronavirus Scientific
  Knowledge Search</title>
    <summary>  With worldwide concerns surrounding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a rapidly growing body of literature on
the virus. Clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers need a way to effectively
search these articles. In this work, we present a search system called SLEDGE,
which utilizes SciBERT to effectively re-rank articles. We train the model on a
general-domain answer ranking dataset, and transfer the relevance signals to
SARS-CoV-2 for evaluation. We observe SLEDGE's effectiveness as a strong
baseline on the TREC-COVID challenge (topping the learderboard with an nDCG@10
of 0.6844). Insights provided by a detailed analysis provide some potential
future directions to explore, including the importance of filtering by date and
the potential of neural methods that rely more heavily on count signals. We
release the code to facilitate future work on this critical task at

    <title>Coronavirus Perceptions And Economic Anxiety</title>
    <summary>  We provide one of the first systematic assessments of the development and
determinants of economic anxiety at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
Using a global dataset on internet searches and two representative surveys from
the US, we document a substantial increase in economic anxiety during and after
the arrival of the coronavirus. We also document a large dispersion in beliefs
about the pandemic risk factors of the coronavirus, and demonstrate that these
beliefs causally affect individuals' economic anxieties. Finally, we show that
individuals' mental models of infectious disease spread understate non-linear
growth and shape the extent of economic anxiety.

    <title>Online Information Search During COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Public information search data from sources such as Google Trends affords
researchers a perspective on what society does not know, or what society wants
to find out prompted by, or in response to, developments in societal
communication and news media events. In times of crisis, online public
information search thus offers a window into the most urgent concerns of, and
demands by society. By extension, such data offers a window into upcoming, and
currently pressing demands on businesses, policymakers and researchers. This
research note aims to illustrate some of these themes with a visual-based
overview of the current COVID-19 / Coronavirus crisis.

    <title>The Pace and Pulse of the Fight against Coronavirus across the US, A
  Google Trends Approach</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus pandemic is impacting our lives at unprecedented speed and
scale - including how we eat and work, what we worry about, how much we move,
and our ability to earn. Google Trends can be used as a proxy for what people
are thinking, needing, and planning. We use it to provide both insights into,
and potential indicators of, important changes in information-seeking patterns
during pandemics like COVID-19. Key questions we address are: (1) What is the
relationship between the coronavirus outbreak and internet searches related to
healthcare seeking, government support programs, media sources of different
ideologies, planning around social activities, travel, and food, and new
coronavirus-specific behaviors and concerns?; (2) How does the popularity of
search terms differ across states and regions and can we explain these
differences?; (3) Can we find distinct, tangible search patterns across states
suggestive of policy gaps to inform pandemic response? (4) Does Google Trends
data correlate with and potentially precede real-life events? We suggest
strategic shifts for policy makers to improve the precision and effectiveness
of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and recommend the development of a
real-time dashboard as a decision-making tool. Methods used include trend
analysis of US search data; geographic analyses of the differences in search
popularity across US states during March 1st to April 15th, 2020; and Principal
Component Analyses (PCA) to extract search patterns across states.

    <title>Large Arabic Twitter Dataset on COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), emerged late December 2019 in China,
is now rapidly spreading across the globe. At the time of writing this paper,
the number of global confirmed cases has passed two millions and half with over
180,000 fatalities. Many countries have enforced strict social distancing
policies to contain the spread of the virus. This have changed the daily life
of tens of millions of people, and urged people to turn their discussions
online, e.g., via online social media sites like Twitter. In this work, we
describe the first Arabic tweets dataset on COVID-19 that we have been
collecting since January 1st, 2020. The dataset would help researchers and
policy makers in studying different societal issues related to the pandemic.
Many other tasks related to behavioral change, information sharing,
misinformation and rumors spreading can also be analyzed.

    <title>Mathematical assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical
  interventions on curtailing the 2019 novel Coronavirus</title>
    <summary>  A novel Coronavirus pandemic emerged in December of 2019, causing devastating
public health impact across the world. In the absence of a safe and effective
vaccine or antiviral, strategies for mitigating the burden of the pandemic are
focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing,
contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We
develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of
these mitigation strategies. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to
COVID-19 transmission in New York state and the entire US, show that the
pandemic will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario
projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of
anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) in New
York State and the entire US decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%,
respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are
maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. This study shows that early
termination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wave
with burden similar to that projected before the onset of strict
social-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%)
could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents
of New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at
least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks,
such as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant
reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to
elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of other
anti-COVID-19 intervention measures can lead to elimination of the pandemic.
The mask coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if mask-use is
combined with strict social-distancing.

    <title>COVID-DA: Deep Domain Adaptation from Typical Pneumonia to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already
infected millions of people and is still rapidly spreading all over the globe.
Most COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic
method is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images.
However, such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to
limited diagnostic efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such
as deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to
improve diagnostic efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty
is the limited availability of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive
annotation costs and urgent work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This
makes the learning of deep diagnosis models very challenging. To address this,
motivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19
and many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct
domain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two
main challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2)
the task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To
address them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19
diagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy
via feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a
novel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose
COVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations.
Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COVID-DA and its great
potential for real-world applications.

    <title>MiniSeg: An Extremely Minimum Network for Efficient COVID-19
  Segmentation</title>
    <summary>  The rapid spread of the new pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
has seriously threatened global health. The gold standard for COVID-19
diagnosis is the tried-and-true polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but PCR is a
laborious, time-consuming and complicated manual process that is in short
supply. Deep learning based computer-aided screening, e.g., infection
segmentation, is thus viewed as an alternative due to its great successes in
medical imaging. However, the publicly available COVID-19 training data are
limited, which would easily cause overfitting of traditional deep learning
methods that are usually data-hungry with millions of parameters. On the other
hand, fast training/testing and low computational cost are also important for
quick deployment and development of computer-aided COVID-19 screening systems,
but traditional deep learning methods, especially for image segmentation, are
usually computationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose
MiniSeg, a lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation.
Compared with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant
strengths: i) it only has 472K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii)
it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical
deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private
COVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a
comprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg with
traditional methods. Code and models will be released to promote the research
and practical deployment for computer-aided COVID-19 screening.

    <title>COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size</title>
    <summary>  The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an
unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human
societies. Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the
outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely
disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban
areas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19
in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling
relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading
faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an
uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to
become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of
these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need
to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also
preserving socioeconomic activity.

    <title>Spatial-Temporal Dataset of COVID-19 Outbreak in China</title>
    <summary>  We present Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) statistics in China dataset:
daily statistics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China at the city/county level.
For each city/country, we include the six most important numbers for epidemic
research: daily new infections, accumulated infections, daily new recoveries,
accumulated recoveries, daily new deaths, and accumulated deaths. We cross
validate the dataset and the estimate error rate is about 0.04%. We then give
several examples to show how to trace the spreading in particular cities or
provinces, and also contrast the development of COVID-19 in all cities in China
at the early, middle and late stages. We hope this dataset can help researchers
around the world better understand the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 at a
regional level, to inform intervention and mitigation strategies for
policymakers.

    <title>What is the people posting about symptoms related to Coronavirus in
  Bogota, Colombia?</title>
    <summary>  During the last months, there is an increasing alarm about a new mutation of
coronavirus, covid-19 coined by World Health Organization(WHO) with an impact
in many areas: economy, health, politics and others. This situation was
declared a pandemic by WHO, because of the fast expansion over many countries.
At the same time, people is using Social Networks to express what they think,
feel or experiment, so this people are Social Sensors and helps to analyze what
is happening in their city. The objective of this paper is analyze the
publications of Colombian people living in Bogota with a radius of 50 km using
Text Mining techniques from symptomatology approach. The results support the
understanding of the spread in Colombia related to symptoms of covid19.

    <title>Inhibition of the Main Protease 3CL-pro of the Coronavirus Disease 19
  via Structure-Based Ligand Design and Molecular Modeling</title>
    <summary>  We have applied a computational strategy, based on the synergy of virtual
screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying
possible lead compounds for the non-covalent inhibition of the main protease
3CL-pro of the SARS-Cov2 Coronavirus. Based on the recently resolved 6LU7 PDB
structure, ligands were generated using a multimodal structure-based design and
then optimally docked to the 6LU7 monomer. Docking calculations show that
ligand-binding is strikingly similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases,
irrespectively of the protonation state of the catalytic CYS-HIS dyad. The most
potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic
moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement. Molecular
dynamics calculations fully confirm the stability in the 3CL-pro binding pocket
of the most potent binder identified by docking, namely a
chlorophenyl-pyridyl-carboxamide derivative.

    <title>predCOVID-19: A Systematic Study of Clinical Predictive Models for
  Coronavirus Disease 2019</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging respiratory disease
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due
to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems
are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of
SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical
ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on
healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we
study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and
based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to
receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care.
To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a
retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of
5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models
identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a
sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%,
51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92
AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require
critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine
which clinical features are predictive to what degree for each of the
aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive models
trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical
pathways for COVID-19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources.

    <title>In Silico Investigations on the Potential Inhibitors for COVID-19
  Protease</title>
    <summary>  A novel strain of coronavirus, namely, COVID-19 has been identified in Wuhan
city of China in December 2019. There are no specific therapies available and
investigations regarding the treatment of the COVID-19 are still lacking. This
prompted us to perform a preliminary in silico study on the COVID-19 protease
with anti-malarial compounds in the search of potential inhibitor. We have
calculated log P and log S values in addition to molecular docking and PASS
predictions. Among the seven studied compounds, mepacrine appears as the
potential inhibitor of the COVID-19 followed by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine
and phomarin. Therefore, these anti-malarial drugs may be potential drug
candidate for the treatment of this novel coronavirus. A detailed analysis on
these inhibitors is currently in progress and clinical studies are invited to
investigate their potential medicinal use for the COVID-19.

    <title>Deposition distribution of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the human
  airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol</title>
    <summary>  The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly
spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from
person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person
coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding
to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by
cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the
majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper
respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral
airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction
of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways.
While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as
well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid
how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells.
The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of
SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this
purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size
distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing
normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct
infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a
bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the
extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we
concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2
infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the
enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less
dangerous...

    <title>Deep Learning for Screening COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray Images</title>
    <summary>  With the ever increasing demand for screening millions of prospective "novel
coronavirus" or COVID-19 cases, and due to the emergence of high false
negatives in the commonly used PCR tests, the necessity for probing an
alternative simple screening mechanism of COVID-19 using radiological images
(like chest X-Rays) assumes importance. In this scenario, machine learning (ML)
and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect
abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which
may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the
available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks.
Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning
(DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on
a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four
classes viz. $normal$, $other\_disease$, $pneumonia$ and $Covid-19$. A 5-fold
cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays
to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of
replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was
measured as $95.3\% \pm 0.02$. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19
detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation
Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention
during the classification. This was found to strongly correlate with clinical
findings, as validated by experts.

    <title>Hypergraph Learning for Identification of COVID-19 with CT Imaging</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has become the largest global public
health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a
complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid
identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases.
The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in
the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and
imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty
Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP
using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional
features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each
case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a
hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph.
The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score
measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process
of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case
belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia
dataset, consisting of 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from five
hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on
the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

    <title>COVID-19 diagnosis by routine blood tests using machine learning</title>
    <summary>  Physicians taking care of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have
described different changes in routine blood parameters. However, these
changes, hinder them from performing COVID-19 diagnosis. We constructed a
machine learning predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis. The model was based
and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5,333 patients with various
bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected
operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 97.9%. The
cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. The five most useful
routine blood parameters for COVID19 diagnosis according to the feature
importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were MCHC, eosinophil count,
albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. tSNE visualization showed
that the blood parameters of the patients with severe COVID-19 course are more
like the parameters of bacterial than viral infection. The reported diagnostic
accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest
CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now
have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients
with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies
to confirm the diagnosis. We believe that our results present a significant
contribution to improvements in COVID-19 diagnosis.

    <title>SARS-CoV originated from bats in 1998 and may still exist in humans</title>
    <summary>  SARS-CoV is believed to originate from civets and was thought to have been
eliminated as a threat after the 2003 outbreak. Here, we show that human
SARS-CoV (huSARS-CoV) originated directly from bats, rather than civets, by a
cross-species jump in 1991, and formed a human-adapted strain in 1998. Since
then huSARS-CoV has evolved further into highly virulent strains with genotype
T and a 29-nt deletion mutation, and weakly virulent strains with genotype C
but without the 29-nt deletion. The former can cause pneumonia in humans and
could be the major causative pathogen of the SARS outbreak, whereas the latter
might not cause pneumonia in humans, but evolved the ability to co-utilize
civet ACE2 as an entry receptor, leading to interspecies transmission between
humans and civets. Three crucial time points - 1991, for the cross-species jump
from bats to humans; 1998, for the formation of the human-adapted SARS-CoV; and
2003, when there was an outbreak of SARS in humans - were found to associate
with anomalously low annual precipitation and high temperatures in Guangdong.
Anti-SARS-CoV sero-positivity was detected in 20% of all the samples tested
from Guangzhou children who were born after 2005, suggesting that weakly
virulent huSARS-CoVs might still exist in humans. These existing but undetected
SARS-CoVs have a large potential to evolve into highly virulent strains when
favorable climate conditions occur, highlighting a potential risk for the
reemergence of SARS.

    <title>Coronavirus: Case for Digital Money?</title>
    <summary>  We discuss the pros of adopting government-issued digital currencies as well
as a supranational digital iCurrency. One such pro is to get rid of paper money
(and coinage), a ubiquitous medium for spreading germs, as highlighted by the
recent coronavirus outbreak. We set forth three policy recommendations for
adapting mobile devices as new digital wallets, regulatory oversight of
sovereign digital currencies and user data protection, and a supranational
digital iCurrency for facilitating international digital monetary linkages.

    <title>Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics</title>
    <summary>  The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is rapidly spreading since December
2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are
limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal
propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global
locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related
to population migration from Hubei resembling a L\'{e}vy flight which is
characteristic of human mobility and thus could be controlled by efficient
quarantines. Since quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight
can be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Our results suggest that
the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process.
At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is close
to constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals
before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately
exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant
differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations.
While most cities in China control the disease which resulted in the decaying
stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse
probably due to less social interactions control and overloaded health systems
which reflects in the death and recovery rates.

    <title>Dynamical modelling and analysis of COVID-19 in India</title>
    <summary>  We consider the pandemic spreading of COVID-19 in India after the outbreak of
the coronavirus in Wuhan city, China. We estimate the transmission rate of the
initial infecting individuals of COVID-19 in India by using the officially
reported data at the early stage of the epidemic with the help of Susceptible
(S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Removed (R) population model, the so-called
SEIR dynamical model. Numerical analysis and model verification are performed
to calibrate the system parameters with official public information about the
number of people infected, and then to evaluate several COVID -19 scenarios
potentially applicable to India. Our findings provide an estimation of disease
occurrence in the near future and also demonstrate the importance of
governmental and individual efforts to control the effects and time of the
pandemic-related critical situations. We also give special emphasis to
individual reactions in the containment process.

    <title>Can AI help in screening Viral and COVID-19 pneumonia?</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, which has already
caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions of people
worldwide. Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19
infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to healthcare
professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of
COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which
is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray
imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in
the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of
artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19
from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique
for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images
applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection
accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public
databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The
database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579
normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help
of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two
different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and
COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification
accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were
99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%,
respectively.

    <title>Twitter discussions and concerns about COVID-19 pandemic: Twitter data
  analysis using a machine learning approach</title>
    <summary>  The objective of the study is to examine coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
related discussions, concerns, and sentiments that emerged from tweets posted
by Twitter users. We collected 22 million Twitter messages related to the
COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as "coronavirus,"
"COVID-19," "quarantine" from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We used a machine
learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular
unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected
Tweets. Popular unigrams included "virus," "lockdown," and "quarantine."
Popular bigrams included "COVID-19," "stay home," "corona virus," "social
distancing," and "new cases." We identified 13 discussion topics and
categorized them into different themes, such as "Measures to slow the spread of
COVID-19," "Quarantine and shelter-in-place order in the U.S.," "COVID-19 in
New York," "Virus misinformation and fake news," "A need for a vaccine to stop
the spread," "Protest against the lockdown," and "Coronavirus new cases and
deaths." The dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus were
anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of
trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public revealed a significant
feeling of fear when they discussed the coronavirus new cases and deaths. The
study concludes that Twitter continues to be an essential source for
infodemiology study by tracking rapidly evolving public sentiment and measuring
public interests and concerns. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and
mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs
a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic. Hearing and
reacting to real concerns from the public can enhance trust between the
healthcare systems and the public as well as prepare for a future public health
emergency.

    <title>DeepCOVIDExplainer: Explainable COVID-19 Diagnosis Based on Chest X-ray
  Images</title>
    <summary>  Amid the coronavirus disease(COVID-19) pandemic, humanity experiences a rapid
increase in infection numbers across the world. Challenge hospitals are faced
with, in the fight against the virus, is the effective screening of incoming
patients. One methodology is the assessment of chest radiography(CXR) images,
which usually requires expert radiologist's knowledge. In this paper, we
propose an explainable deep neural networks(DNN)-based method for automatic
detection of COVID-19 symptoms from CXR images, which we call
DeepCOVIDExplainer. We used 15,959 CXR images of 15,854 patients, covering
normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. CXR images are first comprehensively
preprocessed, before being augmented and classified with a neural ensemble
method, followed by highlighting class-discriminating regions using
gradient-guided class activation maps(Grad-CAM++) and layer-wise relevance
propagation(LRP). Further, we provide human-interpretable explanations of the
predictions. Evaluation results based on hold-out data show that our approach
can identify COVID-19 confidently with a positive predictive value(PPV) of
91.6%, 92.45%, and 96.12%; precision, recall, and F1 score of 94.6%, 94.3%, and
94.6%, respectively for normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases, respectively,
making it comparable or improved results over recent approaches. We hope that
our findings will be a useful contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and,
in more general, towards an increasing acceptance and adoption of AI-assisted
applications in the clinical practice.

    <title>ReCOVery: A Multimodal Repository for COVID-19 News Credibility Research</title>
    <summary>  First identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19
has been declared as a global emergency in January, and a pandemic in March
2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Along with this pandemic, we are
also experiencing an "infodemic" of information with low credibility such as
fake news and conspiracies. In this work, we present ReCOVery, a repository
designed and constructed to facilitate the studies of combating such
information regarding COVID-19. We first broadly search and investigate ~2,000
news publishers, from which 61 are identified with extreme [high or low] levels
of credibility. By inheriting the credibility of the media on which they were
published, a total of 2,029 news articles on coronavirus, published from
January to May 2020, are collected in the repository, along with 140,820 tweets
that reveal how these news articles are spread on the social network. The
repository provides multimodal information of news articles on coronavirus,
including textual, visual, temporal, and network information. The way that news
credibility is obtained allows a trade-off between dataset scalability and
label accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to present data statistics
and distributions, as well as to provide baseline performances for predicting
news credibility so that future methods can be directly compared. Our
repository is available at http://coronavirus-fakenews.com, which will be
timely updated.

    <title>COVID-19 on Social Media: Analyzing Misinformation in Twitter
  Conversations</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the
interconnected-ness of our present-day globalized world. With social distancing
policies in place, virtual communication has become an important source of
(mis)information. As increasing number of people rely on social media platforms
for news, identifying misinformation has emerged as a critical task in these
unprecedented times. In addition to being malicious, the spread of such
information poses a serious public health risk. To this end, we design a
dashboard to track misinformation on popular social media news sharing platform
- Twitter. The dashboard allows visibility into the social media discussions
around Coronavirus and the quality of information shared on the platform,
updated over time. We collect streaming data using the Twitter API from March
1, 2020 to date and identify false, misleading and clickbait contents from
collected Tweets. We provide analysis of user accounts and misinformation
spread across countries. In addition, we provide analysis of public sentiments
on intervention policies such as "#socialdistancing" and "#workfromhome", and
we track topics, and emerging hashtags and sentiments over countries. The
dashboard maintains an evolving list of misinformation cascades, sentiments and
emerging trends over time, accessible online at

    <title>City size and the spreading of COVID-19 in Brazil</title>
    <summary>  The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an
unprecedented example of how fast an infectious disease can spread around the
globe (especially in urban areas) and the enormous impact it causes on public
health and socio-economic activities. Despite the recent surge of
investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know
little about the effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in
urban areas. Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19
scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate that large
cities are proportionally more affected by COVID-19, such that every 1% rise in
population is associated with 0.57% increase in the number of cases per capita
and 0.25% in the number of deaths per capita. The difference between the
scaling of cases and deaths indicates the case fatality rate decreases with
city size. The latest estimates show that a 1% increase in population
associates with a 0.14% reduction in the case fatality rate of COVID-19;
however, this urban advantage has decreased over time. We interpret this to be
due to the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the
largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in large urban areas. We
also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to be higher in large
cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in large cities and to
increase in small ones during the long-term course of the pandemic.

    <title>Predicting the cumulative number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in
  China from early data</title>
    <summary>  We model the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in China. We use early reported
case data to predict the cumulative number of reported cases to a final size.
The key features of our model are the timing of implementation of major public
policies restricting social movement, the identification and isolation of
unreported cases, and the impact of asymptomatic infectious cases.

    <title>Regression Approach for Modeling COVID-19 Spread and its Impact On Stock
  Market</title>
    <summary>  The paper studies different regression approaches for modeling COVID-19
spread and its impact on the stock market. The logistic curve model was used
with Bayesian regression for predictive analytics of the coronavirus spread.
The impact of COVID-19 was studied using regression approach and compared to
other crises influence. In practical analytics, it is important to find the
maximum of coronavirus cases per day, this point means the estimated half time
of coronavirus spread in the region under investigation. The obtained results
show that different crises with different reasons have different impact on the
same stocks. It is important to analyze their impact separately. Bayesian
inference makes it possible to analyze the uncertainty of crisis impacts.

    <title>Discovering associations in COVID-19 related research papers</title>
    <summary>  A COVID-19 pandemic has already proven itself to be a global challenge. It
proves how vulnerable humanity can be. It has also mobilized researchers from
different sciences and different countries in the search for a way to fight
this potentially fatal disease. In line with this, our study analyses the
abstracts of papers related to COVID-19 and coronavirus-related-research using
association rule text mining in order to find the most interestingness words,
on the one hand, and relationships between them on the other. Then, a method,
called information cartography, was applied for extracting structured knowledge
from a huge amount of association rules. On the basis of these methods, the
purpose of our study was to show how researchers have responded in similar
epidemic/pandemic situations throughout history.

    <title>Extracting the effective contact rate of COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  In the absence of any available vaccines or drugs, prevention of the spread
of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being achieved by putting
many mitigation measures in place. It is indispensable to have robust and
reliable ways of evaluating the effectiveness of these measures. In this work,
we assume that, at a very coarse-grained level of description, the overall
effect of all the mitigation measures is that we can still describe the spread
of the pandemic using the most basic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed
($SEIR$) model but with an "effective contact rate" ($\beta$) which is
time-dependent. We then use the time series data of the number of infected
individuals in the population to extract the instantaneous effective contact
rate which is the result of various social interventions put in place. This
approach has the potential to be significantly useful while evaluating the
impact of mitigation measures on the spread of COVID-19 in near future.

    <title>Modeling the transmission of new coronavirus in São Paulo State,
  Brazil -- Assessing epidemiological impacts of isolating young and elder
  persons</title>
    <summary>  We developed a mathematical model to describe the transmission of new
coronavirus in the S\~ao Paulo State, Brazil. The model divided a community in
subpopulations comprised by young and elder persons, in order to take into
account higher risk of fatality among elder persons with severe CoViD-19. From
data collected in the S\~ao Paulo State, we estimated the transmission and
additional mortality rates, from which we calculated the basic reproduction
number R0. From estimated parameters, estimation of the deaths due to CoViD-19
was three times lower than those found in literature. Considering isolation as
a control mechanism, we varied isolation rates of young and elder persons in
order to assess their epidemiological impacts. The epidemiological scenarios
focused mainly on evaluating the number of severe CoViD-19 cases and deaths due
to this disease when isolation is introduced in a population.

    <title>Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing
the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung
infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to
augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However,
segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including
high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between
infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is
impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep
model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection
Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify
infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial
decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map.
Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized
to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate
the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation
framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only
requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our
semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher
performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes
demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge
segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.

    <title>CovidSens: A Vision on Reliable Social Sensing for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  With the spiraling pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it
has becoming inherently important to disseminate accurate and timely
information about the disease. Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and
smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing
paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we
propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing based risk alert systems to
spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer COVID-19 propagation.
CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the
COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas. The CovidSens concept is
motivated by three observations: 1) people actively share their experience of
COVID-19 via online social media, 2) official warning channels and news
agencies are relatively slower than people reporting on social media, and 3)
online users are frequently equipped with powerful mobile devices that can
perform data processing and analytics. We envision unprecedented opportunities
to leverage posts generated by ordinary people to build real-time sensing and
analytic system for gathering and circulating COVID-19 propagation data.
Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to
distill reliable information on COVID-19 with prevailing rumors and
misinformation? How to inform the general public about the state of the spread
timely and effectively? How to leverage the computational power on edge devices
to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms? In this
vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify potential
challenges in developing reliable social sensing based risk alert systems. We
envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines can be effective
in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for
future work in CovidSens.

    <title>Nanomechanical sonification of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus spike protein
  through a materiomusical approach</title>
    <summary>  Proteins are key building blocks of virtually all life, providing the
material foundation of spider silk, cells, and hair, but also offering other
functions from enzymes to drugs, and pathogens like viruses. Based on a
nanomechanical analysis of the structure and motions of atoms and molecules at
multiple scales, we report sonified versions of the coronavirus spike protein
of the pathogen of COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. The audio signal, created using a novel
nanomechanical sonification method, features an overlay of the vibrational
signatures of the protein's primary, secondary and higher-order structures.
Presenting musical encoding in two versions - one in the amino-acid scale and
one based on equal temperament tuning - the method allows for expressing
protein structures in audible space, offering novel avenues to represent,
analyze and design architectural features across length- and time-scales. We
further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct
protein structures, which offer insights into how genetic mutations, and the
binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly
influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development
of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through
melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other
applications of audible coding of matter include material design by
manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to
broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a
physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as
materiomusic, which is akin to finding a new palette of colors for a painter.
Here, the nanomechanical structure of matter, reflected in an oscillatory
framework, presents a new palette for sound generation, and can complement or
support human creativity.

  Classification with Chest CT</title>
    <summary>  Chest computed tomography (CT) becomes an effective tool to assist the
diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19
worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19
classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of
clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep
Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images.
Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then,
in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the
relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn
high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature
selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the
redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively
incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed
AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of
community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN),
specificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and
96.35%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that
the proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP
classification, compared with 4 widely used machine learning methods.

    <title>Hispidin and Lepidine E: two Natural Compounds and Folic acid as
  Potential Inhibitors of 2019-novel coronavirus Main Protease (2019-nCoVMpro),
  molecular docking and SAR study</title>
    <summary>  2019-nCoV is a novel coronavirus was isolated and identified in 2019 in
Wuhan, China. On 17th February and according to world health organization, a
number of 71 429 confirmed cases worldwide, among them 2162 new cases recorded
in the last 24 hours. There is no drug or vaccine for human and animal
coronavirus. The inhibition of 3CL hydrolase enzyme provides a promising
therapeutic principle for developing treatments against CoViD-19. The 3CLpro
(Mpro) known for involving in counteracting the host innate immune response.
This work presents the inhibitory effect of some natural compounds against 3CL
hydrolase enzyme, and explain the main interactions in inhibitor-enzyme
complex. Molecular docking study carried out using Autodock Vina. By screening
several molecules, we identified three candidate agents that inhibit the main
protease of coronavirus. Hispidin, lepidine E, and folic acid bound tightly in
the enzyme, strong hydrogen bonds have been formed (1.69-1.80&amp;[Aring]) with the
active site residues. This study provides a possible therapeutic strategy for
CoViD-19.

    <title>Weibo-COV: A Large-Scale COVID-19 Social Media Dataset from Weibo</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid development of COVID-19, people are asked to maintain "social
distance" and "stay at home". In this scenario, more and more social
interactions move online, especially on social media like Twitter and Weibo.
People post tweets to share information, express opinions and seek help during
the pandemic, and these tweets on social media are valuable for studies against
COVID19, such as early warning and outbreaks detection. Therefore, in this
paper, we release a novel large-scale COVID-19 social media dataset from Weibo
called Weibo-COV, covering more than 40 million tweets from 1 December 2019 to
30 April 2020. Moreover, the field information of the dataset is very rich,
including basic tweets information, interactive information, location
information and retweet network. We hope this dataset can promote studies of
COVID-19 from multiple perspectives and enable better and faster researches to
suppress the spread of this disease.

    <title>Information Seeking Responses to News of Local COVID-19 Cases: Evidence
  from Internet Search Data</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a global pandemic with community
circulation in many countries, including the U.S. where every state is
reporting confirmed cases. The course of this pandemic will be largely shaped
by how governments enact timely policies, disseminate the information, and most
importantly, how the public reacts to them. Here, we examine informationseeking
responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. By using
an eventstudy framework, we show that such news increases collective attention
to the crisis right away, but the elevated level of attention is short-lived,
even though the initial announcements were followed by increasingly strong
measures. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their
state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by
searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms and hand sanitizer. On the other
hand, searches for information regarding community level policies (e.g.,
quarantine, school closures, testing), or personal health strategies (e.g.,
masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be
immediately triggered by first reports. These results are encouraging given our
study period is relatively early in the epidemic and more elaborate policy
responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis will
track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information.

    <title>Iteratively Pruned Deep Learning Ensembles for COVID-19 Detection in
  Chest X-rays</title>
    <summary>  We demonstrate use of iteratively pruned deep learning model ensembles for
detecting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection with chest X-rays
(CXRs). The disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus
(2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and a selection of
pretrained CNN models are trained on publicly available CXR collections to
learn CXR modality-specific feature representations and the learned knowledge
is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the
related task of classifying normal, bacterial pneumonia, and CXRs exhibiting
COVID-19 abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to
identify optimal number of neurons in the convolutional layers to reduce
complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the
best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble
strategies to improve classification performance. The custom and pretrained
CNNs are evaluated at the patient-level to alleviate issues due to information
leakage and reduce generalization errors. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly
improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs as compared to the
individual constituent models. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge
transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved
predictions. We expect that this model can be quickly adopted for COVID-19
screening using chest radiographs.

    <title>An orbital glass state of a nearly metallic spinel, CoV$_2$O$_4$</title>
    <summary>  Strain, magnetization, and unpolarized and polarized neutron diffraction
measurements were performed to study the magnetic and structural properties of
spinel CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. Magnetostriction measurements indicate that a subtle
distortion of the crystal along the direction of magnetization, $\Delta L/L
\sim 10^{-4}$, exists and varies from elongation to contraction in a second
order fashion upon cooling. Unpolarized and polarized single-crystal neutron
experiments indicate that upon cooling the ferrimagnetic structure changes from
collinear to noncollinear at $T \sim 90$ K, where the elongation of the crystal
is maximized. These results imply the existence of an orbital glassy state in
the nearly metallic frustrated magnet CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$.

    <title>Modeling and forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic in India</title>
    <summary>  Background: The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic dilated rapidly throughout India.
To end the global COVID-19 pandemic major behavioral, social distancing,
contact tracing, and state interventions has been undertaken to reduce the
outbreak and avert the persistence of the coronavirus in humans in India and
worldwide. In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost
priority for health care planning and control the transmission of COVID-19.
  Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission
dynamics of COVID-19 in India. Based on the estimated data our model predicts
the evolution of epidemics and the end of SARS-CoV-2 and aids to evaluate the
influence of different policies to control the spread of the diseases.
  Findings: With the real data for infected individuals, we find the basic
reproduction number $R_0$ for 17 states of India and overall India. A complete
figure is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the
real data or history to date. Our study reveals that the strict control
measures implemented in India substantially mitigated the disseminate of
SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, model simulations predict that 95% reduction of
outbreak on June 26, 2020 and 99% reduction of outbreak on July 26, 2020 in
India.
  Interpretation: Our model simulation demonstrates that the community-wide
elimination of SARS-CoV-2 is possible by mitigating the social distancing and
use essential precautions. Lockdown can be implemented strictly to prevent the
human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The model-based and parameter
estimation of epidemic life cycle, and end dates, if can be done precisely, may
decrease distress and over optimism and develop the mentality for all of us for
the next stages of the outbreak evolution.

    <title>Detection of Covid-19 From Chest X-ray Images Using Artificial
  Intelligence: An Early Review</title>
    <summary>  In 2019, the entire world is facing a situation of health emergency due to a
newly emerged coronavirus (COVID-19). Almost 196 countries are affected by
covid-19, while USA, Italy, China, Spain, Iran, and France have the maximum
active cases of COVID-19. The issues, medical and healthcare departments are
facing in delay of detecting the COVID-19. Several artificial intelligence
based system are designed for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest
x-rays. In this article we will discuss the different approaches used for the
detection of COVID-19 and the challenges we are facing. It is mandatory to
develop an automatic detection system to prevent the transfer of the virus
through contact. Several deep learning architecture are deployed for the
detection of COVID-19 such as ResNet, Inception, Googlenet etc. All these
approaches are detecting the subjects suffering with pneumonia while its hard
to decide whether the pneumonia is caused by COVID-19 or due to any other
bacterial or fungal attack.

    <title>JCS: An Explainable COVID-19 Diagnosis System by Joint Classification
  and Segmentation</title>
    <summary>  Recently, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic disease
over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the infection,
the first and key step is to identify and separate the infected people. But due
to the lack of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests,
it is essential to discover suspected COVID-19 patients via CT scan analysis by
radiologists. However, CT scan analysis is usually time-consuming, requiring at
least 15 minutes per case. In this paper, we develop a novel Joint
Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to perform real-time and
explainable COVID-19 diagnosis. To train our JCS system, we construct a large
scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167
CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 CT images of
200 patients are annotated with fine-grained pixel-level labels, lesion counts,
infected areas and locations, benefiting various diagnosis aspects. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that, the proposed JCS diagnosis system is very
efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an average
sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification test set,
and 78.3% Dice score on the segmentation test set, of our COVID-CS dataset. The
online demo of our JCS diagnosis system will be available soon.

    <title>Forecasting the effect of COVID-19 on the S&amp;P500</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented
disruptions to financial and economic markets around the globe, leading to one
of the fastest U.S. stock market declines in history. However, in the past we
have seen the market recover and we can expect the market to recover again, and
on this basis we assume the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P500) index will reach a
minimum before rising again in the not-too-distant future. Here we present four
forecast models of the S&amp;P500 based on COVID-19 projections of deaths released
on 02/04/2020 by the University of Washington and the 2-months consideration
since the first confirmed case occured in USA. The decline and recovery in the
index is estimated for the following three months. The forecast is a projection
of a prediction with fluctuations described by $q$-gaussian distributions. Our
forecast was made on the premise that: (a) The prediction is based on a
deterministic trend that follows the data available since the initial outbreak
of COVID-19, and (b) fluctuations derived from the S&amp;P500 over the last 24

    <title>CoronaVis: A Real-time COVID-19 Tweets Analyzer</title>
    <summary>  The goal of ConronaVis is to use tweets as the information shared by the
people to visualize topic modeling, study subjectivity and to model the human
emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main objective is to explore the
psychology and behavior of the societies at large which can assist in managing
the economic and social crisis during the ongoing pandemic as well as the
after-effects of it. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forced people to
stay at home to reduce the spread of the virus by maintaining the social
distancing. However, social media is keeping people connected both locally and
globally. People are sharing information (e.g. personal opinions, some facts,
news, status, etc.) on social media platforms which can be helpful to
understand the various public behavior such as emotions, sentiments, and
mobility during the ongoing pandemic. In this paper, we describe the CoronaVis
Twitter dataset (focused on the United States) that we have been collecting
from early March 2020. The dataset is available to the research community at
https://github.com/mykabir/COVID19. We would like to share this data with the
hope that it will enable the community to find out more useful insights and
create different applications and models to fight with COVID-19 pandemic and
the future pandemics as well.

    <title>COVID-19 growth prediction using multivariate long short term memory</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread forecasting is an important task to
track the growth of the pandemic. Existing predictions are merely based on
qualitative analyses and mathematical modeling. The use of available big data
with machine learning is still limited in COVID-19 growth prediction even
though the availability of data is abundance. To make use of big data in the
prediction using deep learning, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) method to
learn the correlation of COVID-19 growth over time. The structure of an LSTM
layer is searched heuristically until the best validation score is achieved.
First, we trained training data containing confirmed cases from around the
globe. We achieved favorable performance compared with that of the recurrent
neural network (RNN) method with a comparable low validation error. The
evaluation is conducted based on graph visualization and root mean squared
error (RMSE). We found that it is not easy to achieve the same quantity of
confirmed cases over time. However, LSTM provide a similar pattern between the
actual cases and prediction. In the future, our proposed prediction can be used
for anticipating forthcoming pandemics. The code is provided here:

    <title>Prediction of repurposed drugs for treating lung injury in COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019
and currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory
failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks
efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory
failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in
COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified
tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating
lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene
expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human
COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that
twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value &lt;0.05) overlap between HCC515
cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues,
including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as
TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these
twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such
as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of
twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also
uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In
summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms
leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and
CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.

    <title>What Types of COVID-19 Conspiracies are Populated by Twitter Bots?</title>
    <summary>  With people moving out of physical public spaces due to containment measures
to tackle the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, online platforms become
even more prominent tools to understand social discussion. Studying social
media can be informative to assess how we are collectively coping with this
unprecedented global crisis. However, social media platforms are also populated
by bots, automated accounts that can amplify certain topics of discussion at
the expense of others. In this paper, we study 43.3M English tweets about
COVID-19 and provide early evidence of the use of bots to promote political
conspiracies in the United States, in stark contrast with humans who focus on
public health concerns.

    <title>Multi-Channel Transfer Learning of Chest X-ray Images for Screening of
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly all over the world
and it is affecting the whole society. The current gold standard test for
screening COVID-19 patients is the polymerase chain reaction test. However, the
COVID-19 test kits are not widely available and time-consuming. Thus, as an
alternative, chest X-rays are being considered for quick screening. Since the
presentation of COVID-19 in chest X-rays is varied in features and
specialization in reading COVID-19 chest X-rays are required thus limiting its
use for diagnosis. To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays by
radiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based
on ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray.
Three ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and c) were retrained using Dataset_A
(1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and 1763
non-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19),
respectively, to classify (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or
non-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19. Finally, these three models
were ensembled and fine-tuned using Dataset_D (1579 normal, 4245 pneumonia, and
184 COVID-19) to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. Our results
show that the ensemble model is more accurate than the single ResNet model,
which is also re-trained using Dataset_D as it extracts more relevant semantic
features for each class. Our approach provides a precision of 94 % and a recall
of 100%. Thus, our method could potentially help clinicians in screening
patients for COVID-19, thus facilitating immediate triaging and treatment for
better outcomes.

    <title>COVID-CAPS: A Capsule Network-based Framework for Identification of
  COVID-19 cases from X-ray Images</title>
    <summary>  Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has abruptly and undoubtedly changed the
world as we know it at the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. COVID-19
is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early
diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health
care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition
and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test,
however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity.
Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal
specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung
infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging.
Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural
Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs,
however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and
require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework
based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of
handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and
rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images
show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS
achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and
Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable
parameters in comparison to its counterparts. To further improve diagnosis
capabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training based on a new dataset constructed
from an external dataset of X-ray images. Pre-training with a dataset of
similar nature further improved accuracy to 98.3% and specificity to 98.6%.

    <title>Electrical probing of COVID-19 spike protein receptor binding domain via
  a graphene field-effect transistor</title>
    <summary>  Here, in an effort towards facile and fast screening/diagnosis of novel
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we combined the unprecedently sensitive
graphene field-effect transistor (Gr-FET) with highly selective
antibody-antigen interaction to develop a coronavirus immunosensor. The Gr-FET
immunosensors can rapidly identify (about 2 mins) and accurately capture the
COVID-19 spike protein S1 (which contains a receptor binding domain, RBD) at a
limit of detection down to 0.2 pM, in a real-time and label-free manner.
Further results ensure that the Gr-FET immunosensors can be promisingly applied
to screen for high-affinity antibodies (with binding constant up to 2*10^11
M^-1 against the RBD) at concentrations down to 0.1 pM. Thus, our developed
electrical Gr-FET immunosensors provide an appealing alternative to address the
early screening/diagnosis as well as the analysis and rational design of
neutralizing-antibody locking methods of this ongoing public health crisis.

    <title>Decoding SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution and ramification on COVID-19
  diagnosis, vaccine, and medicine</title>
    <summary>  Tremendous effort has been given to the development of diagnostic tests,
preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Much of this development has been based on the reference genome
collected on January 5, 2020. Based on the genotyping of 6156 genome samples
collected up to April 24, 2020, we report that SARS-CoV-2 has had 4459
alarmingly mutations which can be clustered into five subtypes. We introduce
mutation ratio and mutation $h$-index to characterize the protein
conservativeness and unveil that SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, main protease,
and endoribonuclease protein are relatively conservative, while SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and papain-like protease are relatively
non-conservative. In particular, the nucleocapsid protein has more than half
its genes changed in the past few months, signaling devastating impacts on the
ongoing development of COVID-19 diagnosis, vaccines, and drugs.

    <title>Drug repurposing prediction for COVID-19 using probabilistic networks
  and crowdsourced curation</title>
    <summary>  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS-CoV-2), the virus
responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, represents an
unprecedented global health challenge. Consequently, a large amount of research
into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in
a short time frame. However, developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy
process, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic. Drug
repurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing drugs
have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements. In this work we
used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search
integrated knowledge graphs, identifying drug repurposing opportunities for
COVID-19. We demonstrate the value of this approach, reporting on eight
potential repurposing opportunities identified, and discuss how this approach
could be incorporated into future studies.

    <title>COVID-19 Public Sentiment Insights and Machine Learning for Tweets
  Classification</title>
    <summary>  Along with the Coronavirus pandemic, another crisis has manifested itself in
the form of mass fear and panic phenomena, fueled by incomplete and often
inaccurate information. There is therefore a tremendous need to address and
better understand COVID-19's informational crisis and gauge public sentiment,
so that appropriate messaging and policy decisions can be implemented. In this
research article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic
using Coronavirus specific Tweets and R statistical software, along with its
sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the progress of
fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United
States, using descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data
visualizations. Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two
essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of
textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus
Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91%
for short Tweets, with the Naive Bayes method. We also observe that the
logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74%
with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for
longer Tweets. This research provides insights into Coronavirus fear sentiment
progression, and outlines associated methods, implications, limitations and
opportunities.

    <title>A Multi-Dimensional Big Data Storing System for Generated COVID-19
  Large-Scale Data using Apache Spark</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had burst out in Wuhan
China, specifically in December 2019. COVID-19 has caused by a new virus that
had not been identified in human previously. This was followed by a widespread
and rapid spread of this epidemic throughout the world. Daily, the number of
the confirmed cases are increasing rapidly, number of the suspect increases,
based on the symptoms that accompany this disease, and unfortunately number of
the deaths also increase. Therefore, with these increases in number of cases
around the world, it becomes hard to manage all these cases information with
different situations; if the patient either injured or suspect with which
symptoms that appeared on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need to
construct a multi-dimensional system to store and analyze the generated
large-scale data. In this paper, a Comprehensive Storing System for COVID-19
data using Apache Spark (CSS-COVID) is proposed, to handle and manage the
problem caused by increasing the number of COVID-19 daily. CSS-COVID helps in
decreasing the processing time for querying and storing COVID-19 daily data.
CSS-COVID consists of three stages, namely, inserting and indexing, storing,
and querying stage. In the inserting stage, data is divided into subsets and
then index each subset separately. The storing stage uses set of storing-nodes
to store data, while querying stage is responsible for handling the querying
processes. Using Apache Spark in CSS-COVID leverages the performance of dealing
with large-scale data of the coronavirus disease injured whom increase daily. A
set of experiments are applied, using real COVID-19 Datasets, to prove the
efficiency of CSS-COVID in indexing large-scale data.

    <title>A cascade network for Detecting COVID-19 using chest x-rays</title>
    <summary>  The worldwide spread of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus poses an
unprecedented challenge to the world's medical resources and prevention and
control measures. Covid-19 attacks not only the lungs, making it difficult to
breathe and life-threatening, but also the heart, kidneys, brain and other
vital organs of the body, with possible sequela. At present, the detection of
COVID-19 needs to be realized by the reverse transcription-polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR). However, many countries are in the outbreak period of the
epidemic, and the medical resources are very limited. They cannot provide
sufficient numbers of gene sequence detection, and many patients may not be
isolated and treated in time. Given this situation, we researched the
analytical and diagnostic capabilities of deep learning on chest radiographs
and proposed Cascade-SEMEnet which is cascaded with SEME-ResNet50 and
SEME-DenseNet169. The two cascade networks of Cascade - SEMEnet both adopt
large input sizes and SE-Structure and use MoEx and histogram equalization to
enhance the data. We first used SEME-ResNet50 to screen chest X-ray and
diagnosed three classes: normal, bacterial, and viral pneumonia. Then we used
SEME-DenseNet169 for fine-grained classification of viral pneumonia and
determined if it is caused by COVID-19. To exclude the influence of
non-pathological features on the network, we preprocessed the data with U-Net
during the training of SEME-DenseNet169. The results showed that our network
achieved an accuracy of 85.6\% in determining the type of pneumonia infection
and 97.1\% in the fine-grained classification of COVID-19. We used Grad-CAM to
visualize the judgment based on the model and help doctors understand the chest
radiograph while verifying the effectivene.

    <title>Information Mining for COVID-19 Research From a Large Volume of
  Scientific Literature</title>
    <summary>  The year 2020 has seen an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic due to the outbreak
of a novel strain of coronavirus in 180 countries. In a desperate effort to
discover new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, many scientists are working
around the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from
computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a
treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based
model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on
three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to
coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more
topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness
centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to
drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results
reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine,
Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral
pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae
virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide,
interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus. The
categorical summary of these keywords and topics may be a useful reference to
expedite and recommend new and alternative directions for COVID-19 research.

    <title>Mathematical Modeling of the Spread of COVID-19 in Moscow and Russian
  Regions</title>
    <summary>  To model the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus in Russian regions and in Moscow,
a discrete logistic equation describing the increase in the number of cases is
used. To check the adequacy of the mathematical model, the simulation results
were compared with the spread of coronavirus in China, in a number of European
and Asian countries, and the United States. The parameters of the logistics
equation for Russia, Moscow and other large regions were determined in the
interval (01.03 - 08.04). A comparative analysis of growth rates of COVID-19
infected population for different countries and regions is presented. Various
scenarios of the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus in Moscow and in the regions of
Russia are considered. For each scenario, curves for the daily new cases and
graphs for the increase in the total number of cases were obtained, and the
dynamics of infection spread by day was studied. Peak times, epidemic periods,
the number of infected people at the peak and their growth were determined.

    <title>Residual Attention U-Net for Automated Multi-Class Segmentation of
  COVID-19 Chest CT Images</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly
around the world and caused significant impact on the public health and
economy. However, there is still lack of studies on effectively quantifying the
lung infection caused by COVID-19. As a basic but challenging task of the
diagnostic framework, segmentation plays a crucial role in accurate
quantification of COVID-19 infection measured by computed tomography (CT)
images. To this end, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm for automated
segmentation of multiple COVID-19 infection regions. Specifically, we use the
Aggregated Residual Transformations to learn a robust and expressive feature
representation and apply the soft attention mechanism to improve the capability
of the model to distinguish a variety of symptoms of the COVID-19. With a
public CT image dataset, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in
comparison with other competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our algorithm for automated segmentation of COVID-19
Chest CT images. Our study provides a promising deep leaning-based segmentation
tool to lay a foundation to quantitative diagnosis of COVID-19 lung infection
in CT images.

    <title>The Dynamics of COVID-19 spread in Lebanon</title>
    <summary>  We explore the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Lebanon
by adopting three different approaches, namely the SEIR model, a model of
repeated iterations and a Fermi-Dirac-like model. We fit the first seventy five
days of available daily data since the first diagnosed case and we forecast
possible scenarios of contagion associated with different levels of social
distancing measures. We determine the initial reproductive transmission rate in
Lebanon and its subsequent dynamics. Our results suggest that preserving severe
mitigation measures would halt the spread of the disease. Nevertheless,
relaxing measures would trigger a second outbreak of infections within a couple
of weeks, with severity depending on the extent of relaxation.

    <title>First-principles machine learning modelling of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the world since the World
Health Organization declared its outbreak on 30th January 2020, recognizing the
outbreak as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. As often said by politicians and
scientific advisors, the objective is "to flatten the curve", or "push the peak
down", or similar wording, of the virus spreading. Central to the official
advice are mathematical models and data, which provide estimates on the
evolution of the number of infected, recovered and deaths. The accuracy of the
models is improved day by day by inferring the contact, recovery, and death
rates from data (confirmed cases). A data-driven model trained with {\it both}
data {\it and} first principles is proposed. The model can quickly be
re-trained any time that new data becomes available. The method can be applied
to more detailed epidemic models with virtually no conceptual modification.

    <title>3D Tomographic Pattern Synthesis for Enhancing the Quantification of
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has affected 1.8 million people and
resulted in more than 110,000 deaths as of April 12, 2020. Several studies have
shown that tomographic patterns seen on chest Computed Tomography (CT), such as
ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving pattern, are
correlated with the disease severity and progression. CT imaging can thus
emerge as an important modality for the management of COVID-19 patients.
AI-based solutions can be used to support CT based quantitative reporting and
make reading efficient and reproducible if quantitative biomarkers, such as the
Percentage of Opacity (PO), can be automatically computed. However, COVID-19
has posed unique challenges to the development of AI, specifically concerning
the availability of appropriate image data and annotations at scale. In this
paper, we propose to use synthetic datasets to augment an existing COVID-19
database to tackle these challenges. We train a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) to inpaint COVID-19 related tomographic patterns on chest CTs from
patients without infectious diseases. Additionally, we leverage location priors
derived from manually labeled COVID-19 chest CTs patients to generate
appropriate abnormality distributions. Synthetic data are used to improve both
lung segmentation and segmentation of COVID-19 patterns by adding 20% of
synthetic data to the real COVID-19 training data. We collected 2143 chest CTs,
containing 327 COVID-19 positive cases, acquired from 12 sites across 7
countries. By testing on 100 COVID-19 positive and 100 control cases, we show
that synthetic data can help improve both lung segmentation (+6.02% lesion
inclusion rate) and abnormality segmentation (+2.78% dice coefficient), leading
to an overall more accurate PO computation (+2.82% Pearson coefficient).

    <title>Remote health monitoring in the time of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is rapidly spreading across the globe.
The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically
ill cases and requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical
environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases. The fear of
contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in
on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to
continuously monitor non-severe COVID- 19 patients, either from their
quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels).
Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new
routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has
created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively
monitor patient health status. In this paper we present a short review of
remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 19 states during the time of the
pandemic. We emphasize in the discussion particular aspects that are common
ground for the reviewed states, in particular the future impact of the pandemic
on remote health monitoring and consideration on data privacy.

    <title>Nature of itineracy in CoV$_2$O$_4$: A first principles study</title>
    <summary>  Inspired by recent experiments, we have theoretically explored the nature of
itineracy in CoV$_2$O$_4$ under pressure and investigated, using first
principles density functional theory calculations, if it has any magnetic and
orbital ordering. Our calculations indicate that there could be two possible
routes to obtain the experimentally observed pressure induced metallicity in
this system. One is the spin-orbit interaction coupled with Coulomb correlation
which can take the system from a semiconducting state at ambient pressure to a
metallic state under high pressure. The other mechanism, as indicated by our
GGA+U calculations, is based on the presence of two types of electrons in the
system: localized and itinerant. An effective Falicov-Kimball model could then
possibly explain the observed insulator to metal transition. Comparison of the
two scenarios with existing experimental observations leads us to believe that
the second scenario offers a better explanation for the mechanism of insulator
to metal transition in CoV$_2$O$_4$ under pressure.

    <title>Mapping active allosteric loci SARS-CoV Spike Proteins by means of
  Protein Contact Networks</title>
    <summary>  Coronaviruses are a class of virus responsible of the recent outbreak of
Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The molecular machinery behind the
viral entry and thus infectivity is based on the formation of the complex of
virus spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The
detection of putative allosteric sites on the viral spike protein can trace the
path to develop allosteric drugs to weaken the strength of the spike-ACE2
interface and, thus, reduce the viral infectivity. In this work we present
results of the application of the Protein Contact Network (PCN) paradigm to the
complex SARS-CoV spike - ACE2 relative to both 2003 SARS and the recent 2019 -
CoV. Results point to a specific region, present in both structures, that is
predicted to act as allosteric site modulating the binding of the spike protein
with ACE2.

    <title>Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China by dynamical modeling</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan has
attracted worldwide attention. Here, we propose a generalized SEIR model to
analyze this epidemic. Based on the public data of National Health Commission
of China from Jan. 20th to Feb. 9th, 2020, we reliably estimate key epidemic
parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending
time for 5 different regions. According to optimistic estimation, the epidemics
in Beijing and Shanghai will end soon within two weeks, while for most part of
China, including the majority of cities in Hubei province, the success of
anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of March. The situation in Wuhan
is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 15th. We expect
it will end up at the beginning of April. Moreover, by inverse inference, we
find the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland, Hubei province and Wuhan all can be
dated back to the end of December 2019, and the doubling time is around two
days at the early stage.

    <title>Mapping county-level mobility pattern changes in the United States in
  response to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  To contain the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, one of the
non-pharmacological epidemic control measures in response to the COVID-19
outbreak is reducing the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2 in the population
through (physical) social distancing. An interactive web-based mapping platform
that provides timely quantitative information on how people in different
counties and states reacted to the social distancing guidelines was developed
with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF). It integrates
geographic information systems (GIS) and daily updated human mobility
statistical patterns derived from large-scale anonymized and aggregated
smartphone location big data at the county-level in the United States, and aims
to increase risk awareness of the public, support governmental decision-making,
and help enhance community responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.

    <title>On the Emergence of a Power Law in the Distribution of COVID-19 Cases</title>
    <summary>  The first confirmed case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US was
reported on January 21, 2020. By the end of March, 2020, there were more than
180000 confirmed cases in the US, distributed across more than 2000 counties.
We find that the right tail of this distribution exhibits a power law, with
Pareto exponent close to one. We investigate whether a simple model of the
growth of COVID-19 cases involving Gibrat's law can explain the emergence of
this power law. The model is calibrated to match (i) the growth rates of
confirmed cases, and (ii) the varying lengths of time during which COVID-19 had
been present within each county. Thus calibrated, the model generates a power
law with Pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated
directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of
March.

    <title>AI-Driven CT-based quantification, staging and short-term outcome
  prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia</title>
    <summary>  Chest computed tomography (CT) is widely used for the management of
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia because of its availability and
rapidity. The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on
microbiological tests but these tests might not be available in an emergency
setting and their results are not immediately available, contrary to CT. In
addition to its role for early diagnosis, CT has a prognostic role by allowing
visually evaluating the extent of COVID-19 lung abnormalities. The objective of
this study is to address prediction of short-term outcomes, especially need for
mechanical ventilation. In this multi-centric study, we propose an end-to-end
artificial intelligence solution for automatic quantification and prognosis
assessment by combining automatic CT delineation of lung disease meeting
performance of experts and data-driven identification of biomarkers for its
prognosis. AI-driven combination of variables with CT-based biomarkers offers
perspectives for optimal patient management given the shortage of intensive
care beds and ventilators.

    <title>CoroNet: A deep neural network for detection and diagnosis of COVID-19
  from chest x-ray images</title>
    <summary>  Background and Objective
  The novel Coronavirus also called COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 and has now spread across the world. It has so far infected
around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114,698 lives overall. As
the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing
shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits
and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep
Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19
cases using chest X-rays.
  Methods
  In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model
to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The
proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet
dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and
other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available
databases.
  Results and Conclusion
  CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the
experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy
of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases
are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia
viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal),
the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary
results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more
training data becomes available. Overall, the proposed model substantially
advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic,
it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid
them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.

    <title>COVID-19 Screening on Chest X-ray Images Using Deep Learning based
  Anomaly Detection</title>
    <summary>  Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. To date the novel
COVID-19 coronavirus is rapidly spreading worldwide and subsequently
threatening health of billions of humans. Clinical studies have shown that most
COVID-19 patients suffer from the lung infection. Although chest CT has been
shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis,
chest Xray is more widely available due to its faster imaging time and
considerably lower cost than CT. Deep learning, one of the most successful AI
techniques, is an effective means to assist radiologists to analyze the vast
amount of chest X-ray images, which can be critical for efficient and reliable
COVID-19 screening. In this work, we aim to develop a new deep anomaly
detection model for fast, reliable screening. To evaluate the model
performance, we have collected 100 chest X-ray images of 70 patients confirmed
with COVID-19 from the Github repository. To facilitate deep learning, more
data are needed. Thus, we have also collected 1431 additional chest X-ray
images confirmed as other pneumonia of 1008 patients from the public
ChestX-ray14 dataset. Our initial experimental results show that the model
developed here can reliably detect 96.00% COVID-19 cases (sensitivity being
96.00%) and 70.65% non-COVID-19 cases (specificity being 70.65%) when evaluated
on 1531 Xray images with two splits of the dataset.

    <title>Towards an Effective and Efficient Deep Learning Model for COVID-19
  Patterns Detection in X-ray Images</title>
    <summary>  Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus, the
SARS-CoV-2, is nowadays one of the most prominent challenges of the human
species. A key factor in slowing down the virus propagation is the rapid
diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. Nevertheless, the standard method
for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to the
pandemic. Researchers around the world have been looking for alternative
screening methods. In this context, deep learning applied to chest X-rays of
patients has been showing promising results in the identification of COVID-19.
Despite their success, the computational cost of these methods remains high,
which imposes difficulties in their accessibility and availability. Thus, in
this work, we propose to explore and extend the EfficientNet family of models
using chest X-rays images to perform COVID-19 detection. As a result, we can
produce a high-quality model with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19,
sensitivity of 96.8% and positive prediction of 100% while having about 30
times fewer parameters than the baseline literature model, 28 and 5 times fewer
parameters than the popular VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures, respectively. We
believe the reported figures represent state-of-the-art results, both in terms
of efficiency and effectiveness, for the COVIDx database, a database comprised
of 13,800 X-ray images, 183 of which are from patients affected by COVID-19.

    <title>Weakly Supervised Deep Learning for COVID-19 Infection Detection and
  Classification from CT Images</title>
    <summary>  An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded
in Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic
around the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also
be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in
Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness
may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and
progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden
standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives.
Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources
may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such
circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis
and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly
supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19
infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of
manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection
detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the
promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a
wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.

    <title>Intra-model Variability in COVID-19 Classification Using Chest X-ray
  Images</title>
    <summary>  X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scanning technologies for COVID-19
screening have gained significant traction in AI research since the start of
the coronavirus pandemic. Despite these continuous advancements for COVID-19
screening, many concerns remain about model reliability when used in a clinical
setting. Much has been published, but with limited transparency in expected
model performance. We set out to address this limitation through a set of
experiments to quantify baseline performance metrics and variability for
COVID-19 detection in chest x-ray for 12 common deep learning architectures.
Specifically, we adopted an experimental paradigm controlling for
train-validation-test split and model architecture where the source of
prediction variability originates from model weight initialization, random data
augmentation transformations, and batch shuffling. Each model architecture was
trained 5 separate times on identical train-validation-test splits of a
publicly available x-ray image dataset provided by Cohen et al. (2020). Results
indicate that even within model architectures, model behavior varies in a
meaningful way between trained models. Best performing models achieve a false
negative rate of 3 out of 20 for detecting COVID-19 in a hold-out set. While
these results show promise in using AI for COVID-19 screening, they further
support the urgent need for diverse medical imaging datasets for model training
in a way that yields consistent prediction outcomes. It is our hope that these
modeling results accelerate work in building a more robust dataset and a viable
screening tool for COVID-19.

    <title>Deep Learning on Chest X-ray Images to Detect and Evaluate Pneumonia
  Cases at the Era of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with first
symptoms similar to the flu. COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly
spreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus
pandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary
infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates
deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with
the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the
COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets,
deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from
publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are
proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is
assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context
have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply
health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting
patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show
possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest
X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of
COVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models
retained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators
is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections
and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.

    <title>Dual-Sampling Attention Network for Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Community
  Acquired Pneumonia</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world,
and has infected more than 1,436,000 people in more than 200 countries and
territories as of April 9, 2020. Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential
to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected
population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to
automatically diagnose COVID- 19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in
chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online
attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the
infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there
exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between
COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom
onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the
imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the
largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the
training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a
5-fold cross-validation. In the testing stage, we employ another independent
large-scale testing dataset including 2796 CT scans from 2057 patients. Results
show that our algorithm can identify the COVID-19 images with the area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.944, accuracy of
87.5%, sensitivity of 86.9%, specificity of 90.1%, and F1-score of 82.0%. With
this performance, the proposed algorithm could potentially aid radiologists
with COVID-19 diagnosis from CAP, especially in the early stage of the COVID-19
outbreak.

    <title>Robust Screening of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray via Discriminative
  Cost-Sensitive Learning</title>
    <summary>  This paper addresses the new problem of automated screening of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on chest X-rays, which is urgently demanded
toward fast stopping the pandemic. However, robust and accurate screening of
COVID-19 from chest X-rays is still a globally recognized challenge because of
two bottlenecks: 1) imaging features of COVID-19 share some similarities with
other pneumonia on chest X-rays, and 2) the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is
very high, and the misdiagnosis cost is expensive. While a few pioneering works
have made much progress, they underestimate both crucial bottlenecks. In this
paper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL),
which should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of
COVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained
classification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a
conditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation.
Secondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can
adaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other
classes. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network. We
collected a large-scale multi-class dataset comprised of 2,239 chest X-ray
examples: 239 examples from confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,000 examples with
confirmed bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 examples of healthy
people. Extensive experiments on the three-class classification show that our
algorithm remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. It achieves an
accuracy of 97.01%, a precision of 97%, a sensitivity of 97.09%, and an
F1-score of 96.98%. These results endow our algorithm as an efficient tool for
the fast large-scale screening of COVID-19.

    <title>A structural model for the Coronavirus Nucleocapsid</title>
    <summary>  We propose a mesoscale model structure for the coronavirus nucleocapsid,
assembled from the high resolution structures of the basic building blocks of
the N-protein, CryoEM imaging and mathematical constraints for an overall
quasi-spherical particle. The structure is a truncated octahedron that
accommodates two layers: an outer shell composed of triangular and quadrangular
lattices of the N-terminal domain and an inner shell of equivalent lattices of
coiled parallel helices of the C-terminal domain. The model is consistent with
the dimensions expected for packaging large viral genomes and provides a
rationale to interpret the apparent pleomorphic nature of coronaviruses.

    <title>Low-Cost and High-Throughput Testing of COVID-19 Viruses and Antibodies
  via Compressed Sensing: System Concepts and Computational Experiments</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic infectious disease
outbreak that has significantly harmed and threatened the health and lives of
millions or even billions of people. COVID-19 has also negatively impacted the
social and economic activities of many countries significantly. With no
approved vaccine available at this moment, extensive testing of COVID-19
viruses in people are essential for disease diagnosis, virus spread
confinement, contact tracing, and determining right conditions for people to
return to normal economic activities. Identifying people who have antibodies
for COVID-19 can also help select persons who are suitable for undertaking
certain essential activities or returning to workforce. However, the
throughputs of current testing technologies for COVID-19 viruses and antibodies
are often quite limited, which are not sufficient for dealing with COVID-19
viruses' anticipated fast oscillating waves of spread affecting a significant
portion of the earth's population.
  In this paper, we propose to use compressed sensing (group testing can be
seen as a special case of compressed sensing when it is applied to COVID-19
detection) to achieve high-throughput rapid testing of COVID-19 viruses and
antibodies, which can potentially provide tens or even more folds of speedup
compared with current testing technologies. The proposed compressed sensing
system for high-throughput testing can utilize expander graph based compressed
sensing matrices developed by us \cite{Weiyuexpander2007}.

    <title>Fast and accurate detection of Covid-19-related pneumonia from chest
  X-ray images with novel deep learning model</title>
    <summary>  Background: Novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly worldwide. As recent
radiological literatures on Covid-19 related pneumonia is primarily focused on
CT findings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends using portable
chest X-radiograph (CXR). A tool to assist for detection and monitoring of
Covid-19 cases from CXR is highly required. Purpose: To develop a fully
automatic framework to detect Covid-19 related pneumonia using CXR images and
evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, a novel deep
learning model, named CovIDNet (Covid-19 Indonesia Neural-Network), was
developed to extract visual features from chest x-ray images for the detection
of Covid-19 related pneumonia. The model was trained and validated by chest
x-rays datasets collected from several open source provided by GitHub and
Kaggle. Results and Discussion: In the validation stage using open-source data,
the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is,
100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Discussion: The use of the
model to classify Covid-19 and other pathologies might slightly decrease the
accuracy. Although SoftMax was used to handle classification bias, this
indicates the benefit of additional training upon the introduction of new set
of data. Conclusion: The model has been tested and get 98.4% accuracy for open
source datasets, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 96.97%,
respectively.

    <title>A Cross-Domain Approach to Analyzing the Short-Run Impact of COVID-19 on
  the U.S. Electricity Sector</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread around the globe
in 2020, with the U.S. becoming the epicenter of COVID-19 cases since late
March. As the U.S. begins to gradually resume economic activity, it is
imperative for policymakers and power system operators to take a scientific
approach to understanding and predicting the impact on the electricity sector.
Here, we release a first-of-its-kind cross-domain open-access data hub,
integrating data from across all existing U.S. wholesale electricity markets
with COVID-19 case, weather, cellular location, and satellite imaging data.
Leveraging cross-domain insights from public health and mobility data, we
uncover a significant reduction in electricity consumption across that is
strongly correlated with the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases, degree of
social distancing, and level of commercial activity.

    <title>Sense and Sensibility: Characterizing Social Media Users Regarding the
  Use of Controversial Terms for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  With the world-wide development of 2019 novel coronavirus, although WHO has
officially announced the disease as COVID-19, one controversial term - "Chinese
Virus" is still being used by a great number of people. In the meantime, global
online media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily,
most of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes
increasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media
platforms such as Twitter. When they refer to COVID-19, there are mainly two
ways: using controversial terms like "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus", or using
non-controversial terms like "Coronavirus". In this study, we attempt to
characterize the Twitter users who use controversial terms and those who use
non-controversial terms. We use the Tweepy API to retrieve 17 million related
tweets and the information of their authors. We find significant differences
between these two groups of Twitter users across their demographics, user-level
features like the number of followers, political following status, as well as
their geo-locations. Moreover, we apply classification models to predict
Twitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms. To our best
knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to
characterize users with respect to their usage of controversial terms during a
major crisis.

    <title>Predicting COVID-19 distribution in Mexico through a discrete and
  time-dependent Markov chain and an SIR-like model</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is an emergent viral infection which rose in December 2019 in a city
in the Chinese province of Hubei, Wuhan; the viral aetiology of this infection
is now known as COVID-19 virus, which belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus.
This virus produces the syndrome of acute respiratory stress that h as been
witnessed in other coronaviruses, such as that MERS-CoV in Middle East
countries or SARS-CoV which was seen in 2002 and 2003 in China. This virus
mediates its entry through its spike (S) proteins interacting with ACE2
receptors in lung epithelial cells, and may promote an inflammatory response by
means of inflammasome NLRP3 activation and unfolded protein response (these are
possibly consequence of the envelope E protein of COVID-19 virus). Efforts have
been made worldwide to prevent further spread of the disease, but in March 2020
the WHO declared it a pandemic emergency and Mexico started to report its first
cases. In this paper we attempt to summarize the biological features of the
virus and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of its disease, as well as
a stochastic model characterizing the probability distribution of cases in
Mexico by states and the estimated number of cases in Mexico through a
differential equation model (modified SIR model), thus will we be able to
characterize the disease and its course in Mexico in order to display more
preparedness and promote more logical actions by both the policy makers as well
as the general population.

    <title>Dynamics of the COVID-19 -- Comparison between the Theoretical
  Predictions and Real Data</title>
    <summary>  A new coronavirus disease, called COVID-19, appeared in the Chinese region of
Wuhan at the end of last year; since then the virus spread to other countries,
including most of Europe. We propose a differential equation governing the
evolution of the COVID-19. This dynamic equation also describes the evolution
of the number of infected people for 13 common respiratory viruses (including
the SARS-CoV-2). We validate our theoretical predictions with experimental data
for Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, and compare them with the predictions of the
logistic model. We find that our predictions are in good agreement with the
real world since the beginning of the appearance of the COVID-19; this is not
the case for the logistic model that only applies to the first days. The second
part of the work is devoted to modelling the descending phase, i.e. the
decrease of the number of people tested positive for COVID-19. Also in this
case, we propose a new set of dynamic differential equations that we solved
numerically. We use our differential equations parametrised with experimental
data to make several predictions, such as the date when Italy, Belgium, and
Luxembourg will reach a peak number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people. The
descending curves provide valuable information such as the duration of the
COVID-19 epidemic in a given Country and therefore when it will be possible to
return to normal life.

    <title>Review of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Imaging Data
  Acquisition, Segmentation and Diagnosis for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  (This paper was submitted as an invited paper to IEEE Reviews in Biomedical
Engineering on April 6, 2020.) The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and
computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against
COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical
specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical
imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image
acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also
reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best
protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by
accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating
subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help
radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking,
and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of
medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image
acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on
the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the
frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging
and radiology fighting against COVID-19.

    <title>An automatic COVID-19 CT segmentation network using spatial and channel
  attention mechanism</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a devastating effect
on the global public health. Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective tool in
the screening of COVID-19. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately
segment COVID-19 from CT to help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this
paper, we propose a U-Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism.
As not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for
segmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a
spatial and a channel attention, to a U-Net architecture to re-weight the
feature representation spatially and channel-wise to capture rich contextual
relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal tversky
loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment
results, evaluated on a COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices
are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and
rapid segmentation on COVID-19 segmentation. The method takes only 0.29 second
to segment a single CT slice. The obtained Dice Score, Sensitivity and
Specificity are 83.1%, 86.7% and 99.3%, respectively.

    <title>Searching inhibitors for three important proteins of COVID-19 through
  molecular docking studies</title>
    <summary>  After the first infected patient detected in Wuhan, China in December, 2019
with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus,
the COVID-19 (CO means corona, VI is virus, D is disease, 19 is the year of
discovery) disease spread globally due to its high contagious nature and became
an ongoing pandemic. Also, the lack of vaccines and efficacious drugs to treat
infected patients is a great problem to cope this pandemic. The approved drugs
for similar health problems, reported potential drugs but not yet approved
clinically or under clinical trial, and molecules from medicinal plants
extracts are investigated randomly to deal with the COVID-19 infection.
Molecular docking, one of the best approach to search therapeutically potent
drugs/molecules in real time with possible hope to apply on COVID-19. In this
communication, molecular docking studies of 18 ligands were carried out with
the three important proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike glycoprotein (SGp).
From the obtained results, we observed that all the tested molecules showed
better dock score in compared to the hydroxychloroquine claimed to be effective
against COVID-19. Combining the dock score and other medicinal properties, we
believe the limonin can be further explored for potential use against COVID-19.

    <title>Fractional-order SEIQRDP model for simulating the dynamics of COVID-19
  epidemic</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is known as the causative virus of
outbreak pneumonia initially recognized in the mainland of China, late December
2019. COVID-19 reaches out to many countries in the world, and the number of
daily cases continues to increase rapidly. In order to simulate, track, and
forecast the trend of the virus spread, several mathematical and statistical
models have been developed.
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-Death-Insusceptible
(SEIQRDP) model is one of the most promising dynamic systems that has been
proposed for estimating the transmissibility of the COVID-19. In the present
study, we propose a Fractional-order SEIQRDP model to analyze the COVID-19
epidemic. The Fractional-order paradigm offers a flexible, appropriate, and
reliable framework for pandemic growth characterization. In fact,
fractional-order operator is not local and consider the memory of the
variables. Hence, it takes into account the sub-diffusion process of confirmed
and recovered cases growth. The results of the validation of the model using
real COVID-19 data are presented, and the pertinence of the proposed model to
analyze, understand, and predict the epidemic is discussed.

    <title>CovidCTNet: An Open-Source Deep Learning Approach to Identify Covid-19
  Using CT Image</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is highly contagious with limited
treatment options. Early and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in
reducing the spread of the disease and its accompanied mortality. Currently,
detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the
gold standard of outpatient and inpatient detection of Covid-19. RT-PCR is a
rapid method, however, its accuracy in detection is only ~70-75%. Another
approved strategy is computed tomography (CT) imaging. CT imaging has a much
higher sensitivity of ~80-98%, but similar accuracy of 70%. To enhance the
accuracy of CT imaging detection, we developed an open-source set of algorithms
called CovidCTNet that successfully differentiates Covid-19 from
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lung diseases. CovidCTNet
increases the accuracy of CT imaging detection to 90% compared to radiologists
(70%). The model is designed to work with heterogeneous and small sample sizes
independent of the CT imaging hardware. In order to facilitate the detection of
Covid-19 globally and assist radiologists and physicians in the screening
process, we are releasing all algorithms and parametric details in an
open-source format. Open-source sharing of our CovidCTNet enables developers to
rapidly improve and optimize services, while preserving user privacy and data
ownership.

    <title>Challenges in Combating COVID-19 Infodemic -- Data, Tools, and Ethics</title>
    <summary>  While the COVID-19 pandemic continues its global devastation, numerous
accompanying challenges emerge. One important challenge we face is to
efficiently and effectively use recently gathered data and find computational
tools to combat the COVID-19 infodemic, a typical information overloading
problem. Novel coronavirus presents many questions without ready answers; its
uncertainty and our eagerness in search of solutions offer a fertile
environment for infodemic. It is thus necessary to combat the infodemic and
make a concerted effort to confront COVID-19 and mitigate its negative impact
in all walks of life when saving lives and maintaining normal orders during
trying times. In this position paper of combating the COVID-19 infodemic, we
illustrate its need by providing real-world examples of rampant conspiracy
theories, misinformation, and various types of scams that take advantage of
human kindness, fear, and ignorance. We present three key challenges in this
fight against the COVID-19 infodemic where researchers and practitioners
instinctively want to contribute and help. We demonstrate that these three
challenges can and will be effectively addressed by collective wisdom,
crowdsourcing, and collaborative research.

    <title>ARIMA forecasting of COVID-19 incidence in Italy, Russia, and the USA</title>
    <summary>  The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory infection
that officially occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In late February,
the disease began to spread quickly across the world, causing serious health,
social, and economic emergencies. This paper aims to forecast the short to
medium-term incidence of COVID-19 epidemic through the medium of an
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, applied to Italy,
Russia, and the USA The analysis is carried out on the number of new daily
confirmed COVID-19 cases, collected by Worldometer website. The best ARIMA
models are Italy (4,2,4), Russia (1,2,1), and the USA (6,2,3). The results show
that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to
stabilize; ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19
infections in mid-April, mid-May, and late May, respectively; and iii) Russia
and the USA will require much more time than Italy to drop COVID-19 cases near
zero. This may suggest the importance of the application of quick and effective
lockdown measures, which have been relatively stricter in Italy. Therefore,
even if the results should be interpreted with caution, ARIMA models seem to be
a good tool that can help the health authorities to monitor the diffusion of
the outbreak.

    <title>CO-Search: COVID-19 Information Retrieval with Semantic Search, Question
  Answering, and Abstractive Summarization</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in international efforts to
understand, track, and mitigate the disease, yielding a significant corpus of
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-related publications across scientific disciplines. As
of May 2020, 128,000 coronavirus-related publications have been collected
through the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. Here we present
CO-Search, a retriever-ranker semantic search engine designed to handle complex
queries over the COVID-19 literature, potentially aiding overburdened health
workers in finding scientific answers during a time of crisis. The retriever is
built from a Siamese-BERT encoder that is linearly composed with a TF-IDF
vectorizer, and reciprocal-rank fused with a BM25 vectorizer. The ranker is
composed of a multi-hop question-answering module, that together with a
multi-paragraph abstractive summarizer adjust retriever scores. To account for
the domain-specific and relatively limited dataset, we generate a bipartite
graph of document paragraphs and citations, creating 1.3 million (citation
title, paragraph) tuples for training the encoder. We evaluate our system on
the data of the TREC-COVID information retrieval challenge. CO-Search obtains
top performance on the datasets of the first and second rounds, across several
key metrics: normalized discounted cumulative gain, precision, mean average
precision, and binary preference.

    <title>The Weather Impacts the Outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China</title>
    <summary>  Recent literature has suggested that climate conditions have considerably
significant influences on the transmission of coronavirus COVID-19. However,
there is a lack of comprehensive study that investigates the relationships
between multiple weather factors and the development of COVID-19 pandemic while
excluding the impact of social factors. In this paper, we study the
relationships between six main weather factors and the infection statistics of
COVID-19 on 250 cities in Mainland China. Our correlation analysis using
weather and infection statistics indicates that all the studied weather factors
are correlated with the spread of COVID-19, where precipitation shows the
strongest correlation. We also build a weather-aware predictive model that
forecasts the number of infected cases should there be a second wave of the
outbreak in Mainland China. Our predicted results show that cities located in
different geographical areas are likely to be challenged with the second wave
of COVID-19 at very different time periods and the severity of the outbreak
varies to a large degree, in correspondence with the varying weather
conditions.

    <title>Pandemic News: Facebook Pages of Mainstream News Media and the
  Coronavirus Crisis -- A Computational Content Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge
for news media around the globe. While journalism is meant to process yet
unknown events by design, the dynamically evolving situation affected all
aspects of life in such profound ways that even the routines of crisis
reporting seemed to be insufficient. Critics noted tendencies to horse-race
reporting and uncritical coverage, with journalism being too close to official
statements and too affirmative of political decisions. However, empirical data
on the performance of journalistic news media during the crisis has been
lacking thus far. The current study analyzes the Facebook messages of
journalistic news media during the early Coronavirus crisis, based on a large
German data set from January to March 2020. Using computational content
analysis methods, reach and interactions, topical structure, relevant actors,
negativity of messages, as well as the coverage of fabricated news and
conspiracy theories were examined. The topical structure of the near-time
Facebook coverage changed during various stages of the crisis, with just
partial support for the claims of critics. The initial stages were somewhat
lacking in topical breadth, but later stages offered a broad range of coverage
on Corona-related issues and societal concerns. Further, journalistic media
covered fake news and conspiracy theories during the crisis, but they
consistently contextualized them as what they were and debunked the false
claims circulating in public. While some criticism regarding the performance of
journalism during the crisis received mild empirical support, the analysis did
not find overwhelming signs of systemic dysfunctionalities. Overall,
journalistic media did not default to a uniform reaction nor to sprawling,
information-poor pandemic news, but they responded with a multi-perspective
coverage of the crisis.

    <title>A SIDARTHE Model of COVID-19 Epidemic in Italy</title>
    <summary>  In late December 2019, a novel strand of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing a
severe, potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) was identified in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and is causing outbreaks in multiple world
countries, soon becoming a pandemic. Italy has now become the most hit country
outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a
total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of
paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an
effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a
new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on
whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The
distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because
non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than
diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain
misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic
phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop
life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires
hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the
healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be
redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic
containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19
epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different
possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.

    <title>Do COVID-19 and crude oil prices drive the US economic policy
  uncertainty?</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates the effect of the novel coronavirus and crude oil
prices on the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Using daily
data for the period January 21-March 13, 2020, our Autoregressive Distributed
Lag (ARDL) model shows that the new infection cases reported at global level,
and the death ratio, have no significant effect on the US EPU, whereas the oil
price negative dynamics leads to increased uncertainty. However, analyzing the
situation outside China, we discover that both new case announcements and the
COVID-19 associated death ratio have a positive influence on the US EPU.

    <title>Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Dynamics of COVID-19 and Economic
  Impact</title>
    <summary>  I estimate the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model for
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The transmission rate is heterogeneous
across countries and far exceeds the recovery rate, which enables a fast
spread. In the benchmark model, 28% of the population may be simultaneously
infected at the peak, potentially overwhelming the healthcare system. The peak
reduces to 6.2% under the optimal mitigation policy that controls the timing
and intensity of social distancing. A stylized asset pricing model suggests
that the stock price temporarily decreases by 50% in the benchmark case but
shows a W-shaped, moderate but longer bear market under the optimal policy.

    <title>Monitoring the spread of COVID-19 by estimating reproduction numbers
  over time</title>
    <summary>  To control the current outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019, constant
monitoring of the epidemic is required since, as of today, no vaccines or
antiviral drugs against it are known. We provide daily updated estimates of the
reproduction number over time at
https://stochastik-tu-ilmenau.github.io/COVID-19/. In this document, we
describe the estimator we are using which was developed in (Fraser 2007),
derive its asymptotic properties, and we give details on its implementation.
Furthermore, we validate the estimator on simulated data, demonstrate that
estimates on real data lead to plausible results, and perform a sensitivity
analysis. Finally, we discuss why the estimates obtained need to be interpreted
with care.

    <title>COVID-19 Contact-tracing Apps: a Survey on the Global Deployment and
  Challenges</title>
    <summary>  To address the massive spike in uncertainties triggered by the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19), there is an ever-increasing number of national governments
that are rolling out contact-tracing Apps to aid the containment of the virus.
The first hugely contentious issue facing the Apps is the deployment framework,
i.e. centralized or decentralized. Based on this, the debate branches out to
the corresponding technologies that underpin these architectures, i.e. GPS, QR
codes, and Bluetooth. This work conducts a pioneering review of the above
scenarios and contributes a geolocation mapping of the current deployment. The
Apps vulnerabilities and the directions of research are identified, with a
special focus on the Bluetooth-inspired decentralized paradigm.

    <title>COVID-19 infection and recovery in various countries: Modeling the
  dynamics and evaluating the non-pharmaceutical mitigation scenarios</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic radically impacts our lives,
while the transmission/infection and recovery dynamics of COVID-19 remain
obscure. A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered
(SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series
of COVID-19 evolution observed in the last three months (till 3/22/2020) in
various provinces and metropolises in China. The model results revealed the
space dependent transmission/infection rate and the significant spatiotemporal
variation in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of
screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city
lockdowns in China. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict
COVID-19 evolution in United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea which have
responded differently to monitoring and mitigating COVID-19 so far, although
these predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the
maximum infected population and the infection/recovery rates within the
different countries. In addition, a stochastic model based on the random walk
particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction
model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate
COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the stochastic model showed that
self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing
COVID-19 spread, if not all of the infected people can be promptly diagnosed
and quarantined.

    <title>Hercules: An Autonomous Logistic Vehicle for Contact-less Goods
  Transportation During the COVID-19 Outbreak</title>
    <summary>  Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread
rapidly across China. As at the date of writing this article, the disease has
been globally reported in 100 countries, infected over 100,000 people and
caused over 3,000 deaths. Avoiding person-to-person transmission is an
effective approach to control and prevent the epidemic. However, many daily
activities, such as logistics transporting goods in our daily life, inevitably
involve person-to-person contact. To achieve contact-less goods transportation,
using an autonomous logistic vehicle has become the preferred choice. This
article presents Hercules, an autonomous logistic vehicle used for contact-less
goods transportation during the outbreak of COVID-19. The vehicle is designed
with autonomous navigation capability. We provide details on the hardware and
software, as well as the algorithms to achieve autonomous navigation including
perception, planning and control. This paper is accompanied by a demonstration
video and a dataset, which are available here:

    <title>Modeling the Epidemic Outbreak and Dynamics of COVID-19 in Croatia</title>
    <summary>  The paper deals with a modeling of the ongoing epidemic caused by Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the closed territory of the Republic of Croatia.
Using the official public information on the number of confirmed infected,
recovered and deceased individuals, the modified SEIR compartmental model is
developed to describe the underlying dynamics of the epidemic. Fitted modified
SEIR model provides the prediction of the disease progression in the near
future, considering strict control interventions by means of social distancing
and quarantine for infected and at-risk individuals introduced at the beginning
of COVID-19 spread on February, 25th by Croatian Ministry of Health. Assuming
the accuracy of provided data and satisfactory representativeness of the model
used, the basic reproduction number is derived. Obtained results portray
potential positive developments and justify the stringent precautionary
measures introduced by the Ministry of Health.

    <title>An Overview on Audio, Signal, Speech, &amp; Language Processing for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Recently, there has been an increased attention towards innovating,
enhancing, building, and deploying applications of speech signal processing for
providing assistance and relief to human mankind from the Coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic. Many AI with speech initiatives are taken to combat with
the present situation and also to create a safe and secure environment for the
future. This paper summarises all these efforts taken by the re-search
community towards helping the individuals and the society in the fight against
COVID-19 over the past 3-4 months using speech signal processing. We also
summarise the deep techniques used in this direction to come up with capable
solutions in a short span of time. This paper further gives an overview of the
contributions from non-speech modalities that may complement or serve as
inspiration for audio and speech analysis. In addition, we discuss our
observations with respect to solution usability, challenges, and the
significant technology achievements.

    <title>Machine learning on Big Data from Twitter to understand public reactions
  to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The study aims to understand Twitter users' discussions and reactions about
the COVID-19. We use machine learning techniques to analyze about 1.8 million
Tweets messages related to coronavirus collected from January 20th to March
7th, 2020. A total of salient 11 topics are identified and then categorized
into 10 themes, such as "cases outside China (worldwide)," "COVID-19 outbreak
in South Korea," "early signs of the outbreak in New York," "Diamond Princess
cruise," "economic impact," "Preventive/Protective measures," "authorities,"
and "supply chain". Results do not reveal treatment and/or symptoms related
messages as a prevalent topic on Twitter. We also run sentiment analysis and
the results show that trust for the authorities remained a prevalent emotion,
but mixed feelings of trust for authorities, fear for the outbreak, and
anticipation for the potential preventive measures will be taken are
identified. Implications and limitations of the study are also discussed.

    <title>A Data-Driven Network Model for the Emerging COVID-19 Epidemics in
  Wuhan, Toronto and Italy</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens the health
of humans and causes great economic losses. Predictive modelling and
forecasting the epidemic trends are essential for developing countermeasures to
mitigate this pandemic. We develop a network model, where each node represents
an individual and the edges represent contacts between individuals where the
infection can spread. The individuals are classified based on the number of
contacts they have each day (their node degrees) and their infection status.
The transmission network model was respectively fitted to the reported data for
the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan (China), Toronto (Canada), and the Italian
Republic using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimization algorithm. Our
model fits all three regions well with narrow confidence intervals and could be
adapted to simulate other megacities or regions. The model projections on the
role of containment strategies can help inform public health authorities to
plan control measures.

    <title>Automatic Text Summarization of COVID-19 Medical Research Articles using
  BERT and GPT-2</title>
    <summary>  With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing urgency for medical community
to keep up with the accelerating growth in the new coronavirus-related
literature. As a result, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge has
released a corpus of scholarly articles and is calling for machine learning
approaches to help bridging the gap between the researchers and the rapidly
growing publications. Here, we take advantage of the recent advances in
pre-trained NLP models, BERT and OpenAI GPT-2, to solve this challenge by
performing text summarization on this dataset. We evaluate the results using
ROUGE scores and visual inspection. Our model provides abstractive and
comprehensive information based on keywords extracted from the original
articles. Our work can help the the medical community, by providing succinct
summaries of articles for which the abstract are not already available.

    <title>Sudden Attention Shifts on Wikipedia Following COVID-19 Mobility
  Restrictions</title>
    <summary>  We study how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, alongside the
severe mobility restrictions that ensued, has impacted information access on
Wikipedia, the world's largest online encyclopedia. A longitudinal analysis
that combines pageview statistics for 12 Wikipedia language editions with
mobility reports published by Apple and Google reveals a massive increase in
access volume, accompanied by a stark shift in topical interests. Health- and
entertainment- related topics are found to have gained, and sports- and
transportation- related topics, to have lost attention. Interestingly, while
the interest in health-related topics was transient, that in entertainment
topics is lingering and even increasing. These changes began at the time when
mobility was restricted and are most pronounced for language editions
associated with countries, in which the most severe mobility restrictions were
implemented, indicating that the interest shift might be caused by people's
spending more time at home. Our results highlight the utility of Wikipedia for
studying reactions to the pandemic across the globe, and illustrate how the
disease is rippling through society.

    <title>A low-cost, helmet-based, non-invasive ventilator for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented need for
breathing assistance devices. Since the demand for commercial, full-featured
ventilators is far higher than the supply capacity, many rapid-response
ventilators are being developed for invasive mechanical ventilation of
patients. Most of these emergency ventilators utilize mechanical squeezing of
bag-valve-masks or Ambu-bags. These "bag squeezer" designs are bulky and heavy,
depends on many moving parts, and difficulty to assemble and use. Also,
invasive ventilation requires intensive care unit support, which may be
unavailable to a vast majority of patients, especially in developing countries.
In this work, we present a low-cost ($&lt;$\$200), portable (fits in an 8"x8"x4"
box), non-invasive ventilator (NIV), designed to provide relief to early-stage
COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings. We used a high-pressure blower fan
for providing noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Our design supports
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure
(BiPAP) modes. A common concern of using CPAP or BiPAP for treating COVID-19
patients is the aerosolization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used a helmet-based solution that contains the
spread of the virus. Our end-to-end solution is compact, low-cost ($&lt;$\$400
including the helmet, viral filters, and a valve), and easy-to-use. Our NIV
provides 0-20 cmH$_{2}$O pressure with flow rates of 60-180 Lmin$^{-1}$. We
hope that our report will encourage implementations and further studies on
helmet-based NIV for treating COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings.

    <title>Is SARS-CoV-2 a new Frankenstein monster virus?</title>
    <summary>  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus
of beta coronavirus genus originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019, resulted
in the pandemic spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. This
genus also contains SARS-CoV (originated in China 2002-2003) and MERS-CoV
(found in Saudi Arabia 2012). The nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is closer
to SARS-CoV (with approximately 80% identity) than to MERS-CoV. Despite these
similarities, SARS-CoV-2 has two main features over the other coronaviruses.
The first is the high contagious rate and the second is the immune response
evasion. The higher transmission ability makes this virus quickly spread
worldwide with a high mortality rate and more economic losses. This review will
provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of some viral and host
cell factors in higher transmission and contagious spread of SARS-CoV-2.

    <title>Diagnosing COVID-19 Pneumonia from X-Ray and CT Images using Deep
  Learning and Transfer Learning Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 (also known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus) first emerged in Wuhan, China
and spread across the globe with unprecedented effect and has now become the
greatest crisis of the modern era. The COVID-19 has proved much more pervasive
demands for diagnosis that has driven researchers to develop more intelligent,
highly responsive and efficient detection methods. In this work, we focus on
proposing AI tools that can be used by radiologists or healthcare professionals
to diagnose COVID-19 cases in a quick and accurate manner. However, the lack of
a publicly available dataset of X-ray and CT images makes the design of such AI
tools a challenging task. To this end, this study aims to build a comprehensive
dataset of X-rays and CT scan images from multiple sources as well as provides
a simple but an effective COVID-19 detection technique using deep learning and
transfer learning algorithms. In this vein, a simple convolution neural network
(CNN) and modified pre-trained AlexNet model are applied on the prepared X-rays
and CT scan images dataset. The result of the experiments shows that the
utilized models can provide accuracy up to 98 % via pre-trained network and
94.1 % accuracy by using the modified CNN.

    <title>Semiparametric Bayesian Inference for the Transmission Dynamics of
  COVID-19 with a State-Space Model</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic
affecting over 200 countries and regions. Inference about the transmission
dynamics of COVID-19 can provide important insights into the speed of disease
spread and the effects of mitigation policies. We develop a novel Bayesian
approach to such inference based on a probabilistic compartmental model and
data of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. In particular, we consider a
probabilistic extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered
model, which takes into account undocumented infections and allows the
epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease
transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear
changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We
utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently
sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future
observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive
distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated
datasets. Finally, our approach is applied to COVID-19 data from four states of
the United States: Washington, New York, California, and Illinois. An R package
BaySIR is made available at https://github.com/tianjianzhou/BaySIR for the
public to conduct independent analysis or reproduce the results in this paper.

    <title>The effect of extended closure of red-light areas on COVID-19
  transmission in India</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in over
200,000 cases in India. Thus far, India has implemented lockdown measures to
curb disease transmission. However, commercial sex work in red-light areas
(RLAs) has potential to lead to COVID-19 resurgence after lockdown. We
developed a model of COVID-19 transmission in RLAs, evaluating the impact of
extended RLA closure compared with RLA reopening on cases, hospitalizations,
and mortality rates within the RLAs of five major Indian cities, within the
cities, and across India. Closure lowered transmission at all scales. More than
90% of cumulative cases and deaths among RLA residents of Kolkata, Pune, and
Nagpur could be averted by the time the epidemic would peak under a re-opening
scenario. Across India, extended closure of RLAs would benefit the population
at large, delaying the peak of COVID-19 cases by 8 to 23 days, and avert 32% to
60.2% of cumulative cases and 43% to 67.6% of cumulative deaths at the peak of
the epidemic. Extended closure of RLAs until better prevention and treatment
strategies are developed would benefit public health in India.

    <title>COVID-19 Chest CT Image Segmentation -- A Deep Convolutional Neural
  Network Solution</title>
    <summary>  A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was detected and has spread
rapidly across various countries around the world since the end of the year
2019, Computed Tomography (CT) images have been used as a crucial alternative
to the time-consuming RT-PCR test. However, pure manual segmentation of CT
images faces a serious challenge with the increase of suspected cases,
resulting in urgent requirements for accurate and automatic segmentation of
COVID-19 infections. Unfortunately, since the imaging characteristics of the
COVID-19 infection are diverse and similar to the backgrounds, existing medical
image segmentation methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance. In this
work, we try to establish a new deep convolutional neural network tailored for
segmenting the chest CT images with COVID-19 infections. We firstly maintain a
large and new chest CT image dataset consisting of 165,667 annotated chest CT
images from 861 patients with confirmed COVID-19. Inspired by the observation
that the boundary of the infected lung can be enhanced by adjusting the global
intensity, in the proposed deep CNN, we introduce a feature variation block
which adaptively adjusts the global properties of the features for segmenting
COVID-19 infection. The proposed FV block can enhance the capability of feature
representation effectively and adaptively for diverse cases. We fuse features
at different scales by proposing Progressive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling to
handle the sophisticated infection areas with diverse appearance and shapes. We
conducted experiments on the data collected in China and Germany and show that
the proposed deep CNN can produce impressive performance effectively.

    <title>Towards Efficient COVID-19 CT Annotation: A Benchmark for Lung and
  Infection Segmentation</title>
    <summary>  Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID-19 CT scans plays an
important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the existing
studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical
to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy
fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current
COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets,
trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. In this
paper, we created a COVID-19 3D CT dataset with 20 cases that contains 1800+
annotated slices and made it publicly available. To promote the development of
annotation-efficient deep learning methods, we built three benchmarks for lung
and infection segmentation that contain current main research interests, e.g.,
few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair
comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide unified
training, validation and testing dataset splits, and evaluation metrics and
corresponding code. In addition, we provided more than 40 pre-trained baseline
models for the benchmarks, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation
tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in
COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this
work presents the largest public annotated COVID-19 CT volume dataset, the
first segmentation benchmark, and the most pre-trained models up to now. We
hope these resources
(\url{https://gitee.com/junma11/COVID-19-CT-Seg-Benchmark}) could advance the
development of deep learning methods for COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited
data.

    <title>Blocking of the CD80/86 axis as a therapeutic approach to prevent
  progression to more severe forms of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  In its more severe forms, COVID-19 progresses towards an excessive immune
response, leading to the systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines
like IL6, mostly from the infected lungs. This cytokine storm can cause
multiple organ damage and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to
identify therapies to treat and prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based
on previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell
co-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy
against progression to severe proinflammatory states. To support this
hypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data we
generated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -- a
CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibitor -- with the pathological features associated
with COVID-19, particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many
of the biological processes that have been consistently associated with
COVID-19 pathology are reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including
the downregulation of IL6 production. Also, analysis of previous
transcriptional data from blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients showed that the
response to abatacept has a very high level of antagonism to that elicited by
COVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset from
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a
significant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86+/80+
antigen presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6 production. Our
in-silico study provides additional support to the hypothesis that blocking of
the CD80/CD86 signaling axis may be protective of the excessive proinflammatory
state associated with COVID-19 in the lungs.

    <title>Divergent modes of online collective attention to the COVID-19 pandemic
  are associated with future caseload variance</title>
    <summary>  Using a random 10% sample of tweets authored from 2019-09-01 through
2020-04-30, we analyze the dynamic behavior of words (1-grams) used on Twitter
to describe the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Across 24 languages, we find two
distinct dynamic regimes: One characterizing the rise and subsequent collapse
in collective attention to the initial Coronavirus outbreak in late January,
and a second that represents March COVID-19-related discourse. Aggregating
countries by dominant language use, we find that volatility in the first
dynamic regime is associated with future volatility in new cases of COVID-19
roughly three weeks (average 22.49 $\pm$ 3.26 days) later. Our results suggest
that surveillance of change in usage of epidemiology-related words on social
media may be useful in forecasting later change in disease case numbers, but we
emphasize that our current findings are not causal or necessarily predictive.

    <title>Field induced metamagnetic transitions in quasi-one-dimensional Ising
  spin chain CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$</title>
    <summary>  We have investigated the temperature and magnetic field dependence of
magnetization ($M$), specific heat ($C_p$), and relative sample length change
($\Delta L/L_0$) for understanding the field-induced metamagnetic transitions
in quasi-one-dimensional monoclinic ($\alpha$ phase) and triclinic ($\gamma$
phase) CoV$_2$O$_6$ spin chains. With the application of external magnetic
field, a sharp peak emerges in $C_p$($T$) below $T_N$$=$15 K in $\alpha$ phase
and a hump-like feature appears above $T_N$$=$6.5 K in $\gamma$ phase due to
the field-induced ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic transitions, respectively.
Strong field dependence of linear thermal expansion and large positive
magnetostriction have been observed in $\alpha$ phase. Though magnetization
data indicate strong spin-orbit coupling for both phases, other measurements
show that this effect is very weak for the $\gamma$ phase.

    <title>How relevant is the decision of containment measures against COVID-19
  applied ahead of time?</title>
    <summary>  The cumulative number of confirmed infected individuals by the new
coronavirus outbreak until April 30th, 2020, is presented for the countries:
Belgium, Brazil, United Kingdom (UK), and United States of America (USA). After
an initial period with a low incidence of newly infected people, a power-law
growth of the number of confirmed cases is observed. For each country, a
distinct growth exponent is obtained. For Belgium, UK, and USA, countries with
a large number of infected people, after the power-law growth a distinct
behavior is obtained when approaching saturation. Brazil is still in the
power-law regime. Such updates of the data and projections corroborate recent
results regarding the power-law growth of the virus and their strong Distance
Correlation between some countries around the world. Furthermore, we show that
act in time is one of the most relevant non-pharmacological weapons that the
health organizations have in the battle against the COVID-19, infectious
disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. We study how
changing the social distance and the number of daily tests to identify infected
asymptomatic individuals can interfere in the number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 when applied in three distinct days, namely April 16th (early), April
30th (current), and May 14th (late). Results show that containment actions are
necessary to flatten the curves and should be applied as soon as possible.

    <title>Clinical trials impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: Adaptive designs to
  the rescue?</title>
    <summary>  Very recently the new pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has a number
of consequences for the ongoing clinical trials in non-COVID-19 conditions.
Motivated by four currently ongoing clinical trials in a variety of disease
areas we illustrate the challenges faced by the pandemic and sketch out
possible solutions including adaptive designs. Guidance is provided on (i)
where blinded adaptations can help; (ii) how to achieve type I error rate
control, if required; (iii) how to deal with potential treatment effect
heterogeneity; (iv) how to utilize early readouts; and (v) how to utilize
Bayesian techniques. In more detail approaches to resizing a trial affected by
the pandemic are developed including considerations to stop a trial early, the
use of group-sequential designs or sample size adjustment. All methods
considered are implemented in a freely available R shiny app. Furthermore,
regulatory and operational issues including the role of data monitoring
committees are discussed.

    <title>Using altmetrics for detecting impactful research in quasi-zero-day
  time-windows: the case of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  On December 31st 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country
Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan
City. The cause of the syndrome was a new type of coronavirus isolated on
January 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). Since January 2020 an ever increasing number of scientific works
have appeared in literature. Identifying relevant research outcomes at very
early stages is challenging.In this work we use COVID-19 as a use-case for
investigating: (i) which toos and frameworkds are mostly used for early
scholarly communication; (ii) to what extent altmetrics can be used to identify
potential impactful research in tight (i.e. {\em quasi-zero-day}) time-windows.
A literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria is performed for
gathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19
appeared in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020
to February 24th 2020. This sample is used for building a knowledge graph that
represents the knowledge about papers and indicators formally. This knowledge
graph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting with
altmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional
citation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. This
suggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated
with aforementioned indicators. Additionally, we define a method that
harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact
indicator.

    <title>Transparent Covid-19 prediction</title>
    <summary>  We present a very simple and transparent method to interpret time series of
confirmed Covid-19 cases. Roughly speaking, the analysis of weekly new
infections for each day is a tool for the definition and early detection of the
turning point of the epidemic. In Italy, the growth of Covid-19 activity was
overcome one week ago, Austria and Switzerland followed suit. This note
emphasizes the crucial delay of two weeks between infection and listing of
infection in a central database. Our estimates of the time course of Covid-19
activity and reproduction rates can reduce the information gap by several days.
We show that Spain and Germany are already beyond the turning point. In general
the estimated reproduction rates become undercritical a short time after the
main lockdown measures, and the Covid-19 activity starts to decrease
afterwards. This note gives a very optimistic outlook for all regions which
have taken strict containment measures.

    <title>The early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy</title>
    <summary>  In the night of February 20, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy. In the week
that followed, Lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of
cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the
first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western
Country. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of
confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds,
dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results,
hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction
number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than
February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the
epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The
median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of
positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care.
The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We
estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We
estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around
February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in
nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of
COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely
unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We
observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with
an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. Aggressive
containment strategies are required to control COVID-19 spread and catastrophic
outcomes for the healthcare system.

    <title>Quantification of Tomographic Patterns associated with COVID-19 from
  Chest CT</title>
    <summary>  Purpose: To present a method that automatically segments and quantifies
abnormal CT patterns commonly present in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
namely ground glass opacities and consolidations. Materials and Methods: In
this retrospective study, the proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted
chest CT and segments the lesions, lungs, and lobes in three dimensions, based
on a dataset of 9749 chest CT volumes. The method outputs two combined measures
of the severity of lung and lobe involvement, quantifying both the extent of
COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on deep learning
and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure of (PO, PHO) is global,
while the second of (LSS, LHOS) is lobewise. Evaluation of the algorithm is
reported on CTs of 200 participants (100 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 100
healthy controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe and the United States
collected between 2002-Present (April, 2020). Ground truth is established by
manual annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Correlation and regression
analyses were performed to compare the prediction to the ground truth. Results:
Pearson correlation coefficient between method prediction and ground truth for
COVID-19 cases was calculated as 0.92 for PO (P &lt; .001), 0.97 for PHO(P &lt;
.001), 0.91 for LSS (P &lt; .001), 0.90 for LHOS (P &lt; .001). 98 of 100 healthy
controls had a predicted PO of less than 1%, 2 had between 1-2%. Automated
processing time to compute the severity scores was 10 seconds per case compared
to 30 minutes required for manual annotations. Conclusion: A new method
segments regions of CT abnormalities associated with COVID-19 and computes (PO,
PHO), as well as (LSS, LHOS) severity scores.

    <title>Convolutional Sparse Support Estimator Based Covid-19 Recognition from
  X-ray Images</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been the main agenda of the whole world
since it came in sight in December 2019. It has already caused thousands of
causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool
that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and
possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently
use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT), which require significant time,
resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray imaging is a common and easily
accessible tool that has great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study,
we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images.
Despite the importance of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced
not so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training.
Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art
performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large
datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for
Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based
classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide
satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall
short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address
this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently
been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by
providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse
representation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class
decision in representation based techniques.

    <title>Lights and shadows of COVID-19, Technology and Industry 4.0</title>
    <summary>  Scientific discoveries and technologies played a significant role in the
digital revolution that occurred over the last years. But what is their role in
the turmoil brought by the current pandemic? The aim of this paper is to show
how digital technologies are operating during this first phase of the spreading
of COVID-19. The study analyses and debates the current and potential role of
digital technologies, focusing on their influence in the industrial and social
fields. More specifically we used the blogging platform "Medium", which has
seen an exponential growth in its production of articles over the last couple
of months. Even if different from esteemed scientific sources, this platform
provides a structure that suits our analysis. We searched how many times
digital technologies are mentioned in articles regarding Coronavirus and, after
collecting these articles, we collected page tags (comparable to "keywords" in
scientific articles) and classified them (technology tags and non-technology
tags), to create a graph showing the relation between them. This network
allowed us to acknowledge and picture how technologies are currently debated.
This was the starting point to discuss the key implications for an imminent
future, and question about the impact on industry, society and labour market.
What are the opportunities or threats of using technologies of Industry 4.0?
Which are the needs rising because of the pandemic and how can technologies
help in their fulfillment? How will the industrial scenario change after this
pandemic? How will the labour market be affected? How can technologies be
advantageous in the emerging social challenges?

    <title>Understanding Epidemic Data and Statistics: A case study of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The 2019-Novel-Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 116 countries (By March
12) and out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases. Understanding the
transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which affected on a
daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies is critical
for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-19 reported cases
show more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around
14 percent of infected experienced a severe one and about 5 percent are
categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (2020-03-12; daily
updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran are 80932, 7869, 12462 and 10075;
respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Italy
(2020-03-04), about 7.9% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South
Korea's rate of 0.76% (10 times lower than Italy) and China's 3.8% (50% lower
than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. There are some effective policies
that yield significant changes in the trend of cases. The lockdown policy in
China and Italy (the effect observed after 11 days), Shutdown of all
nonessential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined
policy in South Korea and reducing working hours in Iran.

    <title>Large-Scale Screening of COVID-19 from Community Acquired Pneumonia
  using Infection Size-Aware Classification</title>
    <summary>  The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a
threatening risk for global public health. It is of great importance to rapidly
and accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia
(CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 patients
of CAP underwent thin-section CT. All images were preprocessed to obtain the
segmentations of both infections and lung fields, which were used to extract
location-specific features. An infection Size Aware Random Forest method
(iSARF) was proposed, in which subjects were automated categorized into groups
with different ranges of infected lesion sizes, followed by random forests in
each group for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed
method yielded sensitivity of 0.907, specificity of 0.833, and accuracy of
0.879 under five-fold cross-validation. Large performance margins against
comparison methods were achieved especially for the cases with infection size
in the medium range, from 0.01% to 10%. The further inclusion of Radiomics
features show slightly improvement. It is anticipated that our proposed
framework could assist clinical decision making.

    <title>A time series method to analyze incidence pattern and estimate
  reproduction number of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan,
China in the end of 2019. It has already affected more than 300,000 people,
with the number of deaths nearing 13000 across the world. As it has been posing
a huge threat to global public health, it is of utmost importance to identify
the rate at which the disease is spreading. In this study, we propose a time
series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID-19
outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown,
wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and
using appropriate diagnostic measures, we showed that a time-dependent
quadratic trend successfully captures the incidence pattern of the disease. We
also estimate the basic reproduction number across different countries, and
find that it is consistent except for the United States of America. The above
statistical analysis is able to shed light on understanding the trends of the
outbreak, and gives insight on what epidemiological stage a region is in. This
has the potential to help in prompting policies to address COVID-19 pandemic in
different countries.

    <title>A County-level Dataset for Informing the United States' Response to
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) becomes a global pandemic, policy
makers must enact interventions to stop its spread. Data driven approaches
might supply information to support the implementation of mitigation and
suppression strategies. To facilitate research in this direction, we present a
machine-readable dataset that aggregates relevant data from governmental,
journalistic, and academic sources on the county level. In addition to
county-level time-series data from the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dashboard, our dataset
contains more than 300 variables that summarize population estimates,
demographics, ethnicity, housing, education, employment and in come, climate,
transit scores, and healthcare system-related metrics. Furthermore, we present
aggregated out-of-home activity information for various points of interest for
each county, including grocery stores and hospitals, summarizing data from
SafeGraph. By collecting these data, as well as providing tools to read them,
we hope to aid researchers investigating how the disease spreads and which
communities are best able to accommodate stay-at-home mitigation efforts. Our
dataset and associated code are available at
https://github.com/JieYingWu/COVID-19_US_County-level_Summaries.

    <title>Power-law distribution in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by the
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was first reported on in early December 2019 in
Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole
globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of
the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and
deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both
distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We
are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale
process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the
small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming
exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is
determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm
this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model,
describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our
theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within
a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how
well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite
the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal and
spatial scales of response in which to mitigate future epidemic threats.

    <title>Determination of an Optimal Control Strategy for Vaccine Administration
  in COVID-19 Pandemic Treatment</title>
    <summary>  During decades, mathematical models have been used to predict the behavior of
physical and biologic systems, and to define strategies aiming the minimization
of the effects regarding different types of diseases. In the present days, the
development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the
quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the aim is to determine an
optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic
treatment considering real data from China. For this purpose, an inverse
problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the
compartmental SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. To solve such
inverse problem, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. After
this step, two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) to
determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic
treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of
infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing
together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine
concentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal control
problem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE and
Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The
results regarding the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem provides
a set of evidences from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration
can be chosen, according to a given criterion.

    <title>Estimation of COVID-19 spread curves integrating global data and
  borrowing information</title>
    <summary>  Currently, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big threat to
global health. The rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and
countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected
cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is
very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data
integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful
information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of
infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes
advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an
existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been
adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty
quantification. Additionally, the proposed model uses countrywide covariates to
adjust infection trajectories in curve fitting. A joint variable selection
technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to
identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to
COVID-19.

    <title>COVID-19 pandemic: a mobility-dependent SEIR model with undetected cases
  in Italy, Europe and US</title>
    <summary>  Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in
China at the end of 2019 and has spread worldwide within few weeks reaching a
pandemic status. China and Italy, followed by other countries, have implemented
strict control measures including complete lockdown. The effects of such
measures and the optimal strategies to relax them are major Public Health
concerns. Method: We introduce a SEIR compartmental model describing the
COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account the region-specific fraction of
undetected cases, the effects of mobility restrictions fitting Google COVID-19
Community Mobility Report data, and the personal protective measures adopted as
frequent hand washing or use of masks. Results: The model is experimentally
validated with data of Italian regions, European countries and US, obtaining
fitting parameters in good agreement with previous literature. The mean
absolute percentage error analysis for forecasting accuracy judgement showed
that our model was highly accurate in 12 regions (46%), good in 7 (27%) and
reasonable in 7 (27%). The estimation of the undetected cases allows to
evaluate different post-lockdown scenarios which is crucial for public-health
decision makers. Conclusions: The proposed model, calibrated and designed on
measured or literature-based parameters, was successfully applied in all
scenarios analyzed and the estimation of the dynamic of the whole number of
infectious individuals could help the planning of different strategies aimed at
relaxing the lockdown measures.

    <title>Analyzing COVID-19 on Online Social Media: Trends, Sentiments and
  Emotions</title>
    <summary>  At the time of writing, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) has caused severe impacts on society, economy and people's daily
lives. People constantly express their opinions on various aspects of the
pandemic on social media, making user-generated content an important source for
understanding public emotions and concerns. In this paper, we perform a
comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of the American people and
the Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020
and May 11th 2020. Specifically, by identifying people's sentiments, emotions
(i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the emotional
triggers (e.g., what a user is angry/sad about) we are able to depict the
dynamics of public affect in the time of COVID-19. By contrasting two very
different countries, China and the Unites States, we reveal sharp differences
in people's views on COVID-19 in different cultures. Our study provides a
computational approach to unveiling public emotions and concerns on the
pandemic in real-time, which would potentially help policy-makers better
understand people's need and thus make optimal policy.

    <title>Generic probabilistic modelling and non-homogeneity issues for the UK
  epidemic of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus COVID-19 spreads through the population mostly based on social
contact. To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with
associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust
modelling is centrally important for policy making. We provide a flexible
modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made.
We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation
in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently
probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational
nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and
regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as
medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different
possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to
small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with
different scenarios.
  This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an
epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR).
It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model,
are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used
with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent
uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw
insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources,
including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based
models.

    <title>Mobility Based SIR Model For Pandemics -- With Case Study Of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  In the last decade, humanity has faced many different pandemics such as SARS,
H1N1, and presently novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On one side, scientists are
focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose
models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it
can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared,
especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason
for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different
regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical
area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social
coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the
epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an
important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model
for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the
best of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes into
account the population distribution and connectivity of different geographic
locations across the globe. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of
our model, we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data to
demonstrate our model's generalizability. To demonstrate the wider scope of our
model, we used our model to forecast the COVID-19 cases for Estonia.

    <title>Covid-19 pandemic and the unprecedented mobilisation of scholarly
  efforts prompted by a health crisis: Scientometric comparisons across SARS,
  MERS and 2019-nCov literature</title>
    <summary>  During the current century, each major coronavirus outbreak has triggered a
quick surge of academic publications on this topic. The spike in research
publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19), however, has been
like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised
scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than
12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day.
With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to
have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here,
scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted
with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. SARS and MERS.
The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and
citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain
recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three
outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies:
(i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii)
studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii)
studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies
affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they
overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other
categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader
variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the
geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of
each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19
studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of
countries compared to SARS and MRS.

    <title>One-shot screening of potential peptide ligands on HR1 domain in
  COVID-19 glycosylated spike (S) protein with deep siamese network</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been declared to be a new international
health emergence and no specific drug has been yet identified. Several methods
are currently being evaluated such as protease and glycosylated spike (S)
protein inhibitors, that outlines the main fusion site among coronavirus and
host cells. Notwithstanding, the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1) domain on the
glycosylated spike (S) protein is the region with less mutability and then the
most encouraging target for new inhibitors drugs.The novelty of the proposed
approach, compared to others, lies in a precise training of a deep neural
network toward the 2019-nCoV virus. Where a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has
been trained to distingue the whole 2019-nCoV protein sequence amongst two
different viruses family such as HIV-1 and Ebola. In this way, the present deep
learning system has precise knowledge of peptide linkage among 2019-nCoV
protein structure and differently, of other works, is not trivially trained on
public datasets that have not been provided any ligand-peptide information for
2019-nCoV. Suddenly, the SNN shows a sensitivity of $83\%$ of peptide affinity
classification, where $3027$ peptides on SATPdb bank have been tested towards
the specific region HR1 of 2019-nCoV exhibiting an affinity of $93\%$ for the
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) peptide. This affinity between
PPIase and HR1 can open new horizons of research since several scientific
papers have already shown that CsA immunosuppression drug, a main inhibitor of
PPIase, suppress the reproduction of different CoV virus included SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV. Finally, to ensure the scientific reproducibility, code and data have
been made public at the following link: https://github.com/bionick87/2019-nCoV

    <title>Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of quasi-one-dimensional Ising
  spin chain CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$</title>
    <summary>  We have investigated the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of
antiferromagnetic Ising spin chain CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ by magnetization and heat
capacity measurements. Both monoclinic $\alpha$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ and triclinic
$\gamma$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ exhibit field-induced metamagnetic transition from
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state via an intermediate ferrimagnetic
state with 1/3 magnetization plateau. Due to this field-induced metamagnetic
transition, these systems show large conventional as well as inverse
magnetocaloric effects. In $\alpha$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$, we observe field-induced
complex magnetic phases and multiple magnetization plateaux at low temperature
when the field is applied along $c$ axis. Several critical temperatures and
fields have been identified from the temperature and field dependence of
magnetization, magnetic entropy change and heat capacity to construct the
$H$-$T$ phase diagram. As compared to $\alpha$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$,
$\gamma$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ displays a relatively simple magnetic phase diagram.
Due to the large magnetic entropy change and adiabatic temperature change at
low or moderate applied magnetic field, $\gamma$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ may be
considered as a magnetic refrigerant in the low-temperature region.

    <title>$α$-Satellite: An AI-driven System and Benchmark Datasets for
  Hierarchical Community-level Risk Assessment to Help Combat COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus and its deadly outbreak have posed grand challenges to
human society: as of March 26, 2020, there have been 85,377 confirmed cases and
1,293 reported deaths in the United States; and the World Health Organization
(WHO) characterized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) - which has infected more
than 531,000 people with more than 24,000 deaths in at least 171 countries - a
global pandemic. A growing number of areas reporting local sub-national
community transmission would represent a significant turn for the worse in the
battle against the novel coronavirus, which points to an urgent need for
expanded surveillance so we can better understand the spread of COVID-19 and
thus better respond with actionable strategies for community mitigation. By
advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the
large-scale and real-time data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g.,
disease related data from official public health organizations, demographic
data, mobility data, and user geneated data from social media), in this work,
we propose and develop an AI-driven system (named $\alpha$-Satellite}, as an
initial offering, to provide hierarchical community-level risk assessment to
assist with the development of strategies for combating the fast evolving
COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, given a specific location (either user
input or automatic positioning), the developed system will automatically
provide risk indexes associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state,
county, city, specific location) to enable individuals to select appropriate
actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent
possible. The developed system and the generated benchmark datasets have been
made publicly accessible through our website. The system description and
disclaimer are also available in our website.

    <title>Automated diagnosis of COVID-19 with limited posteroanterior chest X-ray
  images using fine-tuned deep neural networks</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory syndrome that
resembles pneumonia. The current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based approach which
however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage. Hence, a
more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the
release of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising
of computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists,
researchers and healthcare experts are contributing for faster and automated
diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep learning
approaches to achieve better cure and treatment. These datasets have limited
samples concerned with the positive COVID-19 cases, which raise the challenge
for unbiased learning. Following from this context, this article presents the
random oversampling and weighted class loss function approach for unbiased
fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep
learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2,
DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and
COVID-19 cases) and also multi-class classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia,
and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images. Accuracy, precision, recall,
loss, and area under the curve (AUC) are utilized to evaluate the performance
of the models. Considering the experimental results, the performance of each
model is scenario dependent; however, NASNetLarge displayed better scores in
contrast to other architectures, which is further compared with other recently
proposed approaches. This article also added the visual explanation to
illustrate the basis of model classification and perception of COVID-19 in CXR
images.

    <title>An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach to Assess the ZIP Code Level
  Impact of COVID-19 in NYC</title>
    <summary>  New York City has been recognized as the world's epicenter of the novel
Coronavirus pandemic. To identify the key inherent factors that are highly
correlated to the Increase Rate of COVID-19 new cases in NYC, we propose an
unsupervised machine learning framework. Based on the assumption that ZIP code
areas with similar demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility patterns are likely
to experience similar outbreaks, we select the most relevant features to
perform a clustering that can best reflect the spread, and map them down to 9
interpretable categories. We believe that our findings can guide policy makers
to promptly anticipate and prevent the spread of the virus by taking the right
measures.

    <title>Firefly-Algorithm Supported Scheme to Detect COVID-19 Lesion in Lung CT
  Scan Images using Shannon Entropy and Markov-Random-Field</title>
    <summary>  The pneumonia caused by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is one of major global
threat and a number of detection and treatment procedures are suggested by the
researchers for COVID-19. The proposed work aims to suggest an automated image
processing scheme to extract the COVID-19 lesion from the lung CT scan images
(CTI) recorded from the patients. This scheme implements the following
procedures; (i) Image pre-processing to enhance the COVID-19 lesions, (ii)
Image post-processing to extract the lesions, and (iii) Execution of a relative
analysis between the extracted lesion segment and the Ground-Truth-Image (GTI).
This work implements Firefly Algorithm and Shannon Entropy (FA+SE) based
multi-threshold to enhance the pneumonia lesion and implements
Markov-Random-Field (MRF) segmentation to extract the lesions with better
accuracy. The proposed scheme is tested and validated using a class of COVID-19
CTI obtained from the existing image datasets and the experimental outcome is
appraised to authenticate the clinical significance of the proposed scheme. The
proposed work helped to attain a mean accuracy of &gt;92% during COVID-19 lesion
segmentation and in future, it can be used to examine the real clinical lung
CTI of COVID-19 patients.

    <title>A data driven analysis and forecast of an SEIARD epidemic model for
  COVID-19 in Mexico</title>
    <summary>  We propose an SEIARD mathematical model to investigate the current outbreak
of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Mexico. We conduct a detailed analysis of
this model and demonstrate its application using publicly reported data. We
calculate the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) via the next-generation matrix
method, and we estimate the per day infection, death and recovery rates. We
calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported data by minimizing
the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak
until June 2020. Our results estimate that the peak of the epidemic in Mexico
will be around May 2, 2020. Our model incorporates the importance of
considering the aysmptomatic infected individuals, because they represent the
majority of the infected population (with symptoms or not) and they could play
a huge role in spreading the virus without any knowledge.

    <title>A country comparison of place-based activity response to COVID-19
  policies</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of the novel Coronavirus Disease in late 2019 (COVID-19) and
subsequent pandemic led to an immense disruption in the daily lives of almost
everyone on the planet. Faced with the consequences of inaction, most national
governments responded with policies that restricted the activities conducted by
their inhabitants. As schools and businesses shuttered, the mobility of these
people decreased. This reduction in mobility, and related activities, was
recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices. Patterns
emerged that varied by place-based activity. In this work the differences in
these place-based activity patterns are investigated across nations,
specifically focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies
and changes in community activity patterns. We show that people's activity
response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as
regionally within them. Three assessment measures are devised and the results
correlate with a number of global indices. We discuss these findings and the
relationship between government action and residents' response.

    <title>CovidChain: An Anonymity Preserving Blockchain Based Framework for
  Protection Against Covid-19</title>
    <summary>  Today, the entire world is facing incredible health and economic challenges
due to the rapid spread of the life threatening novel Coronavirus Disease -
2019 (COVID-19). In the prevailing situation when a vaccine is many months
away, the way forward seems to be a controlled exit from the lockdown - where,
infected/exposed people are strictly quarantined and recovered/unexposed people
are allowed to carry on with their day to day business activities. However,
appropriate physical distancing norms will have to be strictly followed for
such relaxations. Therefore, mechanisms are required that will assist people in
following the social and physical distancing norms in public places. In this
paper, we propose an anonymity preserving blockchain based framework that
allows people, through use of their smart phones and other communication
devices, to protect themselves from infections as they conduct their daily
business activities.

    <title>An ARIMA model to forecast the spread and the final size of COVID-2019
  epidemic in Italy</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) is a severe ongoing novel pandemic that is
spreading quickly across the world. Italy, that is widely considered one of the
main epicenters of the pandemic, has registered the highest COVID-2019 death
rates and death toll in the world, to the present day. In this article I
estimate an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast
the epidemic trend over the period after April 4, 2020, by using the Italian
epidemiological data at national and regional level. The data refer to the
number of daily confirmed cases officially registered by the Italian Ministry
of Health (www.salute.gov.it) for the period February 20 to April 4, 2020. The
main advantage of this model is that it is easy to manage and fit. Moreover, it
may give a first understanding of the basic trends, by suggesting the
hypothetic epidemic's inflection point and final size.

    <title>COVID-CT-Dataset: A CT Scan Dataset about COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  During the outbreak time of COVID-19, computed tomography (CT) is a useful
manner for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to privacy issues, publicly
available COVID-19 CT datasets are highly difficult to obtain, which hinders
the research and development of AI-powered diagnosis methods of COVID-19 based
on CTs. To address this issue, we build an open-sourced dataset -- COVID-CT,
which contains 349 COVID-19 CT images from 216 patients and 463 non-COVID-19
CTs. The utility of this dataset is confirmed by a senior radiologist who has
been diagnosing and treating COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this
pandemic. We also perform experimental studies which further demonstrate that
this dataset is useful for developing AI-based diagnosis models of COVID-19.
Using this dataset, we develop diagnosis methods based on multi-task learning
and self-supervised learning, that achieve an F1 of 0.90, an AUC of 0.98, and
an accuracy of 0.89. According to the senior radiologist, models with such
performance are good enough for clinical usage. The data and code are available
at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT

    <title>The Ivory Tower Lost: How College Students Respond Differently than the
  General Public to the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Recently, the pandemic of the novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has
presented governments with ultimate challenges. In the United States, the
country with the highest confirmed COVID-19 infection cases, a nationwide
social distancing protocol has been implemented by the President. For the first
time in a hundred years since the 1918 flu pandemic, the US population is
mandated to stay in their households and avoid public contact. As a result, the
majority of public venues and services have ceased their operations. Following
the closure of the University of Washington on March 7th, more than a thousand
colleges and universities in the United States have cancelled in-person classes
and campus activities, impacting millions of students. This paper aims to
discover the social implications of this unprecedented disruption in our
interactive society regarding both the general public and higher education
populations by mining people's opinions on social media. We discover several
topics embedded in a large number of COVID-19 tweets that represent the most
central issues related to the pandemic, which are of great concerns for both
college students and the general public. Moreover, we find significant
differences between these two groups of Twitter users with respect to the
sentiments they expressed towards the COVID-19 issues. To our best knowledge,
this is the first social media-based study which focuses on the college student
community's demographics and responses to prevalent social issues during a
major crisis.

    <title>Vulnerability of deep neural networks for detecting COVID-19 cases from
  chest X-ray images to universal adversarial attacks</title>
    <summary>  Under the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), chest
X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening
COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep
neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect
COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in
number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the
vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are
vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation
(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we
focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest
X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple
iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure
resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,
which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results
demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,
even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average
norm of an image in the image dataset achieves &gt;85% and &gt;90% success rates for
the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted
UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The
targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given
target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in
practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they
emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example,
we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the
robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.

    <title>Deep Learning System to Screen Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia</title>
    <summary>  We found that the real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) detection of viral RNA from sputum or nasopharyngeal swab has a
relatively low positive rate in the early stage to determine COVID-19 (named by
the World Health Organization). The manifestations of computed tomography (CT)
imaging of COVID-19 had their own characteristics, which are different from
other types of viral pneumonia, such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia. Therefore,
clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type
of pneumonia as soon as possible.This study aimed to establish an early
screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral
pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning
techniques. The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a
3-dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated
images were then categorized into COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and
irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence
scores using a location-attention classification model. Finally the infection
type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy-or
Bayesian function.The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the
overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.The
deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early
screening of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary
diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.

    <title>The Effects of Stringent Interventions for Coronavirus Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused severe public health consequences around
the world. Many interventions of COVID-19 have been implemented. It is of great
public health and societal importance to evaluate the effects of interventions
in the pandemic of COVID-19. In this paper, with help of synthetic control
method, regression discontinuity and a Susceptible-Infected and infectious
without isolation-Hospitalized in isolation-Removed (SIHR) model, we evaluate
the horizontal and longitudinal effects of stringent interventions implemented
in Wenzhou, a representative urban city of China, where stringent interventions
were enforced to curb its own epidemic situation with rapidly increasing newly
confirmed cases. We found that there were statistically significant treatment
effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed
cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time. Also, if
the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were
implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would
have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of
stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of
COVID-19. The slower the interventions were implemented, the more severe the
epidemic would have been, and the stronger the interventions would have been
required.

    <title>The Outbreak Evaluation of COVID-19 in Wuhan District of China</title>
    <summary>  There were 27 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases found in Wuhan, China in
December 2019, named as 2019-nCoV temporarily and COVID-19 formally by WHO on
11 February, 2020. In December 2019 and January 2020, COVID-19 has spread in
large scale among the population, which brought terrible disaster to the life
and property of the Chinese people. In this paper, we will first analyze the
feature and pattern of the virus transmission, and discuss the key impact
factors and uncontrollable factors of epidemic transmission based on public
data. Then the virus transmission can be modelled and used for the inflexion
and extinction period of epidemic development so as to provide theoretical
support for the Chinese government in the decision-making of epidemic
prevention and recovery of economic production. Further, this paper
demonstrates the effectiveness of the prevention methods taken by the Chinese
government such as multi-level administrative region isolation. It is of great
importance and practical significance for the world to deal with public health
emergencies.

    <title>Age-structured impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in
  India</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic
by the WHO. The structures of social contact critically determine the spread of
the infection and, in the absence of vaccines, the control of these structures
through large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective
means of mitigation. Here we use an age-structured SIR model with social
contact matrices obtained from surveys and Bayesian imputation to study the
progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. The basic reproductive ratio R0 and
its time-dependent generalization are computed based on case data, age
distribution and social contact structure. The impact of social distancing
measures - workplace non-attendance, school closure, lockdown - and their
efficacy with durations are then investigated. A three-week lockdown is found
insufficient to prevent a resurgence and, instead, protocols of sustained
lockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested. Forecasts are provided for the
reduction in age-structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these
measures. Our study underlines the importance of age and social contact
structures in assessing the country-specific impact of mitigatory social
distancing.

    <title>Screening of Therapeutic Agents for COVID-19 using Machine Learning and
  Ensemble Docking Simulations</title>
    <summary>  The world has witnessed unprecedented human and economic loss from the
COVID-19 disease, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Extensive
research is being conducted across the globe to identify therapeutic agents
against the SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a powerful and efficient computational
strategy by combining machine learning (ML) based models and high-fidelity
ensemble docking simulations to enable rapid screening of possible therapeutic
molecules (or ligands). Our screening is based on the binding affinity to
either the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at its host receptor region or to the
Sprotein-human ACE2 interface complex, thereby potentially limiting and/or
disrupting the host-virus interactions. We first apply our screening strategy
to two drug datasets (CureFFI and DrugCentral) to identify hundreds of ligands
that bind strongly to the aforementioned two systems. Candidate ligands were
then validated by all atom docking simulations. The validated ML models were
subsequently used to screen a large bio-molecule dataset (with nearly a million
entries) to provide a rank-ordered list of ~19,000 potentially useful compounds
for further validation. Overall, this work not only expands our knowledge of
small-molecule treatment against COVID-19, but also provides an efficient
pathway to perform high-throughput computational drug screening by combining
quick ML surrogate models with expensive high-fidelity simulations, for
accelerating the therapeutic cure of diseases.

    <title>Modeling, state estimation, and optimal control for the US COVID-19
  outbreak</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19 disease have had an
unprecedented spread and continue to cause an increasing number of fatalities
worldwide. While vaccines are still under development, social distancing,
extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the
most effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a
significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel
optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak
in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations,
estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal
control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that
the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive
computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most
effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected
subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that "on-off" policies
alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can
be effective at "flattening" the curve while likely minimizing social and
economic cost.

    <title>Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Population Mobility under Mild
  Policies: Causal Evidence from Sweden</title>
    <summary>  Sweden has adopted far less restrictive social distancing policies than most
countries following the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses data on all mobile
phone users, from one major Swedish mobile phone network, to examine the impact
of the Coronavirus outbreak under the Swedish mild recommendations and
restrictions regime on individual mobility and if changes in geographical
mobility vary over different socio-economic strata. Having access to data for
January-March in both 2019 and 2020 enables the estimation of causal effects of
the COVID-19 outbreak by adopting a Difference-in-Differences research design.
The paper reaches four main conclusions: (i) The daytime population in
residential areas increased significantly (64 percent average increase); (ii)
The daytime presence in industrial and commercial areas decreased significantly
(33 percent average decrease); (iii) The distance individuals move from their
homes during a day was substantially reduced (38 percent decrease in the
maximum distance moved and 36 percent increase in share of individuals who move
less than one kilometer from home); (iv) Similar reductions in mobility were
found for residents in areas with different socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics. These results show that mild government policies can compel
people to adopt social distancing behavior.

    <title>Estimation of Infection Rate and Prediction of Initial Infected
  Individuals of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We consider the pandemic spreading of COVID-19 for some selected countries
after the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan City, China. We estimated the
infection rate and the initial infected individuals of COVID-19 by using the
officially reported data at the early stage of the epidemic for the susceptible
(S), infectable (I), quarantined (Q), and the cofirmed recovered (Rk)
population model, so called SIQRk model. In the reported data we know the
quarantined cases and the recovered cases. We can not know the recovered cases
from the asymptomatic cases. In the SIQRk model we can estimated the model
parameters and the initial infecting cases (confirmed ans asymtomatic cases)
from the data fits. We obtained the infection rate in the range between 0.233
and 0.462, the basic reproduction number Ro in the range between 1.8 and 3.5,
and the initial number of infected individuals in the range betwee 10 and 8409
for some selected countries. By using fitting parameters we estimated the
maximum time of the infection for Germany when the government are performing
the quarantine policy. The disease is undergoing to the calm state about six
months after first patients were identified.

    <title>Global analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using simple epidemiological
  models</title>
    <summary>  Several analytical models have been used in this work to describe the
evolution of death cases arising from coronavirus (COVID-19). The Death or `D'
model is a simplified version of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)
model, which assumes no recovery over time, and allows for the
transmission-dynamics equations to be solved analytically. The D-model can be
extended to describe various focuses of infection, which may account for the
original pandemic (D1), the lockdown (D2) and other effects (Dn). The evolution
of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries (China, Spain, Italy, France, UK,
Iran, USA and Germany) shows a similar behavior in concord with the D-model
trend, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow
decline, which are affected by the earliness and efficiency of the lockdown
effect. These results are in agreement with more accurate calculations using
the extended SIR model with a parametrized solution and more sophisticated
Monte Carlo grid simulations, which predict similar trends and indicate a
common evolution of the pandemic with universal parameters.

    <title>What Can We Learn from the Time Evolution of COVID-19 Epidemic in
  Slovenia?</title>
    <summary>  A recent work (DOI 10.1101/2020.05.06.20093310) indicated that temporarily
splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The fact that, soon afterwards, on May 15, 2020,
the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the
end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this
perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper we investigate the time
dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia with emphasis on how efficient
various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections.
Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical
assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results
presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while
imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate
kappa by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only
improve the \k{appa}-value by ~15 % as compared to the much bearable state of
social and economical life wherein (justifiable) wearing face masks and social
distancing rules are enforced/followed. Significantly for behavioral and social
science, our analysis of the time dependence \k{appa} = \k{appa}(t) may reveal
an interesting self-protection instinct of the population, which became
manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement.

    <title>Predicting Mortality Risk in Viral and Unspecified Pneumonia to Assist
  Clinicians with COVID-19 ECMO Planning</title>
    <summary>  Respiratory complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 have claimed
tens of thousands of lives in 2020. Many cases of COVID-19 escalate from Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) to viral pneumonia to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) to death. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO)
is a life-sustaining oxygenation and ventilation therapy that may be used for
patients with severe ARDS when mechanical ventilation is insufficient to
sustain life. While early planning and surgical cannulation for ECMO can
increase survival, clinicians report the lack of a risk score hinders these
efforts. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop the
PEER score, used to highlight critically ill patients with viral or unspecified
pneumonia at high risk of mortality or decompensation in a subpopulation
eligible for ECMO. The PEER score is validated on two large, publicly available
critical care databases and predicts mortality at least as well as other
existing risk scores. Stratifying our cohorts into low-risk and high-risk
groups, we find that the high-risk group also has a higher proportion of
decompensation indicators such as vasopressor and ventilator use. Finally, the
PEER score is provided in the form of a nomogram for direct calculation of
patient risk, and can be used to highlight at-risk patients among critical care
patients eligible for ECMO.

    <title>A new estimation method for COVID-19 time-varying reproduction number
  using active cases</title>
    <summary>  We propose a new method to estimate the time-varying effective (or
instantaneous) reproduction number of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model
that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which
combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate reported state variables
(active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer
function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with
case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our
method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the
estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We
show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g.,
age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it
to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,
where we see a delay of about four days in predicting the epidemic peak.

    <title>Signaling network analysis and drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment
  based on transcriptional response of lung host cells</title>
    <summary>  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected &gt;5.5 million
people globally and carries a relatively high mortality rate. Currently, there
is no effective vaccine or therapy approved for the treatment COVID-19, though
many such therapeutics are being evaluated in clinical trials. Using the unique
profiles of altered gene expression found in NHBE, A549_ACE2 and Calu3 human
lung epithelial cells after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection, we conducted a computational analysis to identify
dysfunctional signaling pathways within infected cells. Using these data,
potential therapeutic targets were identified and matched with existing
medications to develop a theoretical approach to pharmacologic repurposing and
inform clinical trial decisions. Specifically, signaling pathways upregulated
by SARS-CoV-2 infection and their associated gene ontologies (GOs) were
extracted and clustered to generate 10 super-GOs. The genes associated with the
identified signaling pathways and the super-GOs were used as gene signatures to
identify drugs that can potentially inhibit these signaling cascades. In these
results, interesting signaling pathways and GOs such as JAK-STAT, IRF7-NFkB
signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were identified. Many drugs were
identified with downstream inhibition of these signaling pathways and GOs, and
many of which are currently undergoing clinical trial evaluation. The analysis
results can be potentially helpful to facilitate the future clinical trial
design. Rigorous clinical trial and experimental validations are needed to
validate these results, considering the limitation of pure computational data
analysis based on the noisy and limited data. some of these drugs might have
harmful effects and cautions.

    <title>Radiologist-Level COVID-19 Detection Using CT Scans with Detail-Oriented
  Capsule Networks</title>
    <summary>  Radiographic images offer an alternative method for the rapid screening and
monitoring of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This approach is
limited by the shortage of radiology experts who can provide a timely
interpretation of these images. Motivated by this challenge, our paper proposes
a novel learning architecture, called Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks
(DECAPS), for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from Computed Tomography (CT)
scans. Our network combines the strength of Capsule Networks with several
architecture improvements meant to boost classification accuracies. First,
DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model
stability by preventing the passage of information from non-descriptive
regions. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a
two-stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the network to generate
activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation
maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine-grained
representations of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based
on conditional generative adversarial networks to deal with the issue of data
scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall, and 96.1% area
under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We
compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced,
well-trained thoracic radiologists and show that the architecture significantly
outperforms them. While further studies on larger datasets are required to
confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS can be
used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID-19.

    <title>The effect of norm-based messages on reading and understanding COVID-19
  pandemic response governmental rules</title>
    <summary>  The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) threatens the lives of millions of
people around the world, making it the largest health threat in recent times.
Billions of people around the world are asked to adhere to strict
shelter-in-place rules, finalised to slow down the spread of the virus. Appeals
and messages are being used by leaders and policy-makers to promote pandemic
response. Given the stakes at play, it is thus important for social scientists
to explore which messages are most effective in promoting pandemic response. In
fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of several
messages on people's intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In
this paper, we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages
on people's actual engagement, and not on intentions. Specifically, our
dependent variables are the level of understanding of official COVID-19
pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through
comprehension questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we
test a novel set of appeals built through the theory of norms. One message
targets the personal norm (what people think is the right thing to do), one
targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one
targets the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove
of). Our experiment is conducted online with a representative (with respect to
gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms are made salient using a
flier. We find that norm-based fliers had no effect on comprehension and on
time spent on the panels. These results suggest that norm-based interventions
through fliers have very little impact on people's reading and understanding of
COVID-19 pandemic response governmental rules.

    <title>The effect of messaging and gender on intentions to wear a face covering
  to slow down COVID-19 transmission</title>
    <summary>  Now that various countries are or will soon be moving towards relaxing
shelter-in-place rules, it is important that people use a face covering, to
avoid an exponential resurgence of the spreading of the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19). Here we report a pre-registered online experiment (N=2,459) using a
heterogenous, although not representative, sample of people living in the USA,
where we test the relative effect of messages highlighting that the coronavirus
is a threat to "you" vs "your family" vs "your community" vs "your country" on
self-reported intentions to wear a face covering. Results show that focusing on
"your community" promotes intentions to wear a face covering relative to the
baseline; the trend is the same when comparing "your community" to the other
conditions, but not significant. We also conducted pre-registered analyses of
gender differences on intentions to wear a face covering. We find that men less
than women intend to wear a face covering, but this difference almost
disappears in counties where wearing a face covering is mandatory. We also find
that men less than women believe that they will be seriously affected by the
coronavirus, and this partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear
a face covering (this is particularly ironic because official statistics
actually show that men are affected by the COVID-19 more seriously than women).
Finally, we also find gender differences in self-reported negative emotions
felt when wearing a face covering. Men more than women agree that wearing a
face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness, and a stigma; and
these gender differences also mediate gender differences in intentions to wear
a face covering.

    <title>In-silico nucleotide and protein analyses of S-gene region in selected
  zoonotic coronaviruses reveal conserved domains and evolutionary emergence
  with trajectory course of viral entry from SARS-CoV2 genomic data</title>
    <summary>  The recent zoonotic coronavirus virus outbreak of a novel type [COVID 19] has
necessitated the adequate understanding of the evolutionary pathway of zoonotic
viruses which adversely affects human populations for therapeutic constructs to
combat the pandemic now and in the future. We analyzed conserved domains of the
severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV2] for possible targets of
viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human
coronavirus [229E] and zoonotic coronaviruses with SAR-CoV2 as well as
evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV 2 genomic data. Conserved
domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms
in SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of
the spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses
alongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary
relationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed
between Wuhan SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry
trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines
as early ancestors. Therefore, phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests
profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside
migration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of
viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present
and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.

    <title>When and How to Lift the Lockdown? Global COVID-19 Scenario Analysis and
  Policy Assessment using Compartmental Gaussian Processes</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led many
countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the
outbreak. Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and
whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public
discourse. Data-driven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different
lockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and
informing governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper
develops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown
policies in a global context -- we treat each country as a distinct data point,
and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific
policy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior --
the lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected,
Recovered) model as a prior mean function with "country-and-policy-specific"
parameters that capture fatality curves under "counterfactual" policies within
each country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and
learns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and
its policy indicators. Our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of
SEIR models (Bayesian priors) with the flexible data-driven modeling and
gradient-based optimization routines of machine learning (Bayesian posteriors)
-- i.e., the entire model is trained end-to-end via stochastic variational
inference. We compare the projections of COVID-19 fatalities by our model with
other models listed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and provide
scenario analyses for various lockdown and reopening strategies highlighting
their impact on COVID-19 fatalities.

    <title>Data Driven Modeling of Projected Mitigation and Suppressing Strategy
  Interventions for SARS-COV 2 in Ghana</title>
    <summary>  In the midst of pandemic for respiratory illness, the call for
non-pharmaceutical interventions become the highest priority for infectious
disease and public health experts, while the race towards vaccine or medical
intervention are ongoing. Individuals may modify their behavior and take
preventative steps to reduce infection risk in the bid to adhere to the call by
government officials and experts. As a result, the existence of relationship
between the preliminary and the final transmission rates become feeble. This
study evaluates the behavioral changes (mitigation and suppression measures)
proposed by public health experts for COVID-19 which had altered human behavior
and their day to day lives. The dynamics underlying the mitigation and
suppression measures reduces the contacts among citizens and significantly
interfere with their physical and social behavior. The results show all the
measures have a significant impact on the decline of transmission rate.
However, the mitigation measures might prolong the elimination of the
transmission which might lead to a severe economic meltdown, yet, a combination
of the measures show a possibility of rooting out transmission within 30 days
if adhered to in an extreme manner. The result shows a peak period of infection
for Ghana ranges from 64th day to 74th day of infection time period.

    <title>Orbital order and electron itinerancy in CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and Mn$ _{0.5}
  $Co$ _{0.5} $V$_{2}$O$_{4}$ from first principles</title>
    <summary>  In view of the recent experimental predictions of a weak structural
transition in CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ we explore the possible orbital order states in
its low temperature tetragonal phases from first principles density functional
theory calculations. We observe that the tetragonal phase with I4$_1/amd$
symmetry is associated with an orbital order involving complex orbitals with a
reasonably large orbital moment at Vanadium sites while in the phase with
I4$_1/a$ symmetry, the real orbitals with quenched orbital moment constitute
the orbital order. Further, to study the competition between orbital order and
electron itinerancy we considered Mn$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$V$_{2}$O$_{4}$ as one of
the parent compounds, CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, lies near itinerant limit while the
other, MnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, lies deep inside the orbitally ordered insulating
regime. Orbital order and electron transport have been investigated using first
principles density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory in
CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, MnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and Mn$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$V$_{2}$O$_{4}$. Our
results show that as we go from MnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ to CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ there is
enhancement in the electron's itinerancy while the nature of orbital order
remains unchanged.

    <title>Molecular docking studies on Jensenone from eucalyptus essential oil as
  a potential inhibitor of COVID 19 corona virus infection</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19, a member of corona virus family is spreading its tentacles across
the world due to lack of drugs at present. However, the main viral proteinase
(Mpro/3CLpro) has recently been regarded as a suitable target for drug design
against SARS infection due to its vital role in polyproteins processing
necessary for coronavirus reproduction. The present in silico study was
designed to evaluate the effect of Jensenone, a essential oil component from
eucalyptus oil, on Mpro by docking study. In the present study, molecular
docking studies were conducted by using 1-click dock and swiss dock tools.
Protein interaction mode was calculated by Protein Interactions Calculator.The
calculated parameters such as binding energy, and binding site similarity
indicated effective binding of Jensenone to COVID-19 proteinase. Active site
prediction further validated the role of active site residues in ligand
binding. PIC results indicated that, Mpro/ Jensenone complexes forms
hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond interactions and strong ionic
interactions. Therefore, Jensenone may represent potential treatment potential
to act as COVID-19 Mpro inhibitor. However, further research is necessary to
investigate their potential medicinal use.

    <title>Syndromic surveillance using search query logs and user location
  information from smartphones against COVID-19 clusters in Japan</title>
    <summary>  [Background] Two clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were
confirmed in Hokkaido, Japan in February 2020. To capture the clusters, this
study employs Web search query logs and user location information from
smartphones. [Material and Methods] First, we anonymously identified smartphone
users who used a Web search engine (Yahoo! JAPAN Search) for the COVID-19 or
its symptoms via its companion application for smartphones (Yahoo Japan App).
We regard these searchers as Web searchers who are suspicious of their own
COVID-19 infection (WSSCI). Second, we extracted the location of the WSSCI via
the smartphone application. The spatio-temporal distribution of the number of
WSSCI are compared with the actual location of the known two clusters. [Result
and Discussion] Before the early stage of the cluster development, we could
confirm several WSSCI, which demonstrated the basic feasibility of our
WSSCI-based approach. However, it is accurate only in the early stage, and it
was biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. For the
case where the other cluster-related resources, such as fine-grained population
statistics, are not available, the proposed metric would be helpful to catch
the hint of emerging clusters.

    <title>Development of a Machine-Learning System to Classify Lung CT Scan Images
  into Normal/COVID-19 Class</title>
    <summary>  Recently, the lung infection due to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) affected a
large human group worldwide and the assessment of the infection rate in the
lung is essential for treatment planning. This research aims to propose a
Machine-Learning-System (MLS) to detect the COVID-19 infection using the CT
scan Slices (CTS). This MLS implements a sequence of methods, such as
multi-thresholding, image separation using threshold filter,
feature-extraction, feature-selection, feature-fusion and classification. The
initial part implements the Chaotic-Bat-Algorithm and Kapur's Entropy (CBA+KE)
thresholding to enhance the CTS. The threshold filter separates the image into
two segments based on a chosen threshold 'Th'. The texture features of these
images are extracted, refined and selected using the chosen procedures.
Finally, a two-class classifier system is implemented to categorize the chosen
CTS (n=500 with a pixel dimension of 512x512x1) into normal/COVID-19 group. In
this work, the classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with
linear kernel (SVM) are implemented and the classification task is performed
using various feature vectors. The experimental outcome of the SVM with
Fused-Feature-Vector (FFV) helped to attain a detection accuracy of 89.80%.

    <title>Quantifying human mobility behavior changes in response to
  non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United
  States</title>
    <summary>  Ever since the first case of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was
confirmed in Wuhan, China, social distancing has been promoted worldwide,
including the United States. It is one of the major community mitigation
strategies, also known as non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, our
understanding is remaining limited in how people practice social distancing. In
this study, we construct a Social Distancing Index (SDI) to evaluate people's
mobility pattern changes along with the spread of COVID-19. We utilize an
integrated dataset of mobile device location data for the contiguous United
States plus Alaska and Hawaii over a 100-day period from January 1, 2020 to
April 9, 2020. The major findings are: 1) the declaration of the national
emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak greatly encouraged social distancing
and the mandatory stay-at-home orders in most states further strengthened the
practice; 2) the states with more confirmed cases have taken more active and
timely responses in practicing social distancing; 3) people in the states with
fewer confirmed cases did not pay much attention to maintaining social
distancing and some states, e.g., Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana, already
began to practice less social distancing despite the high increasing speed of
confirmed cases; 4) some counties with the highest infection rates are not
performing much social distancing, e.g., Randolph County and Dougherty County
in Georgia, and some counties began to practice less social distancing right
after the increasing speed of confirmed cases went down, e.g., in Blaine
County, Idaho, which may be dangerous as well.

    <title>Accelerating drug repurposing for COVID-19 via modeling drug mechanism
  of action with large scale gene-expression profiles</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, emerged in China in December
2019, and has rapidly spread around the world. It is clearly urgent to fight
COVID-19 at global scale. The development of methods for identifying drug uses
based on phenotypic data can improve the efficiency of drug development.
However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications
based on cell picture data. This work reported one state-of-the-art machine
learning method to identify drug uses based on the cell image features of 1024
drugs generated in the LINCS program. Because the multi-dimensional features of
the image are affected by non-experimental factors, the characteristics of
similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use
deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. As a
consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert
the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML
conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. The
analysis of feature conversion shows that different features play important
roles in identifying different drug functions. For the current COVID-19,
Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine achieve antiviral effects by inhibiting
endocytosis, etc., and were classified to the same community. And Clomiphene in
the same community inibited the entry of Ebola Virus, indicated a similar MoAs
that could be reflected by cell image.

    <title>Longitudinal high-throughput TCR repertoire profiling reveals the
  dynamics of T cell memory formation after mild COVID-19 infection</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The T
cell response is a critical part of both individual and herd immunity to
SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of developed vaccines. However neither the dynamics
and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response nor the
diversity of resulting immune memory are well understood. In this study we use
longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor sequencing to track changes in the
T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19 infection. In both
donors we identified SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones. We
describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones,
suggesting the existence of immunodominant epitopes. We show that in both
donors the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes.
Certain CD4+ clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection
timepoint, suggesting participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T
cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

    <title>Identifying Human Interactors of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins and Drug Targets
  for COVID-19 using Network-Based Label Propagation</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has inflicted
considerable suffering on the human population. In this paper, we aim to
significantly expand the resources available to biological and clinical
researchers who are developing therapeutic targets for drug development and
repositioning. Taking a genome-scale, systems-level view of virus-host
interactions, we adapt and specialize network label propagation methods to
prioritize drug targets based on their probability to inhibit host-pathogen
interactions or their downstream signaling targets. In particular, our results
suggest that we can predict human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2
proteins with high accuracy. Moreover, the top-ranking proteins scored by our
methods are enriched in biological processes that are relevant to the virus. We
discuss cases where our methodology generates promising insights, including the
potential role of HSPA5 in viral entry, the connection of HSPA5 and its
interactors with anti-clotting drugs, and the role of tubulin proteins involved
in ciliary assembly that are targeted by anti-mitotic drugs. Several drugs that
we discuss are already undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy
against COVID-19. We make the prioritized list of human proteins and drug
targets broadly available as a general resource for repositioning of existing
and approved drugs as anti-COVID-19 agents or for novel drug development.

    <title>On COVID-19 Modelling</title>
    <summary>  This contribution analyzes the COVID-19 outbreak by comparably simple
mathematical and numerical methods. The final goal is to predict the peak of
the epidemic outbreak per country with a reliable technique. This is done by an
algorithm motivated by standard SIR models and aligned with the standard data
provided by the Johns Hopkins University. To reconstruct data for the
unregistered Infected, the algorithm uses current values of the infection
fatality rate and a data-driven estimation of a specific form of the recovery
rate. All other ingredients are data-driven as well. Various examples of
predictions are provided for illustration.

    <title>Coronavirus and financial volatility: 40 days of fasting and fear</title>
    <summary>  40 days after the start of the international monitoring of COVID-19, we
search for the effect of official announcements regarding new cases of
infection and death ratio on the financial markets volatility index (VIX).
Whereas the new cases reported in China and outside China have a mixed effect
on financial volatility, the death ratio positively influences VIX, that
outside China triggering a more important impact. In addition, the higher the
number of affected countries, the higher the financial volatility is.

    <title>Use of Available Data To Inform The COVID-19 Outbreak in South Africa: A
  Case Study</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was
declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020.
Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments that have been approved after
clinical trials. Social distancing measures, including travel bans, school
closure, and quarantine applied to countries or regions are being used to limit
the spread of the disease and the demand on the healthcare infrastructure. The
seclusion of groups and individuals has led to limited access to accurate
information. To update the public, especially in South Africa, announcements
are made by the minister of health daily. These announcements narrate the
confirmed COVID-19 cases and include the age, gender, and travel history of
people who have tested positive for the disease. Additionally, the South
African National Institute for Communicable Diseases updates a daily
infographic summarising the number of tests performed, confirmed cases,
mortality rate, and the regions affected. However, the age of the patient and
other nuanced data regarding the transmission is only shared in the daily
announcements and not on the updated infographic. To disseminate this
information, the Data Science for Social Impact research group at the
University of Pretoria, South Africa, has worked on curating and applying
publicly available data in a way that is computer-readable so that information
can be shared to the public - using both a data repository and a dashboard.
Through collaborative practices, a variety of challenges related to publicly
available data in South Africa came to the fore. These include shortcomings in
the accessibility, integrity, and data management practices between
governmental departments and the South African public. In this paper, solutions
to these problems will be shared by using a publicly available data repository
and dashboard as a case study.

    <title>COVID-19 Antibody Test / Vaccination Certification: There's an app for
  that</title>
    <summary>  Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 'Immunity
Passport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to
work. While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and
the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched,
we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving
certification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a
prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that
facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally
identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app
allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with
no other personal information revealed. Behind the scenes it relies upon (a)
the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called 'Verifiable Credentials',
(b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform 'Solid', and (c) a
Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and
decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and
privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital
signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital
keys and/or data. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare
staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which
takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server
architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable,
applicable generically, and in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological
issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be
resolved.

    <title>Analysis and Prediction of COVID-19 Pandemic in Pakistan using
  Time-dependent SIR Model</title>
    <summary>  The current outbreak is known as Coronavirus Disease or COVID-19 caused by
the virus SAR-COV-2 which continues to wreak havoc across the globe. The World
Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern. In Pakistan, the spread of the virus is on the rise
with the number of infected people and causalities rapidly increasing. In the
absence of proper vaccination and treatment, to reduce the number of infections
and casualties, the only option so far is to educate people regarding
preventive measures and to enforce countrywide lock-down. Any strategy about
the preventive measures needs to be based upon detailed analysis of the
COVID-19 outbreak and accurate scientific predictions. In this paper, we
conduct mathematical and numerical analysis to come up with reliable and
accurate predictions of the outbreak in Pakistan. The time-dependent
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used to fit the data and provide
future predictions. The turning point of the peak of the pandemic is defined as
the day when the transmission rate becomes less than the recovering rate. We
have predicted that the outbreak will reach its maximum peak occurring from
late May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives in the range
20000-47000 and the cumulative number of infected cases in the range of
57500-153100. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end in the
lock-down scenario but can rapidly double or triple if the spread of the
epidemic is not curtailed and localized. The uncertainty on single day
projection in our analysis after April 15 is found to be within 5\%.

    <title>Joint Prediction and Time Estimation of COVID-19 Developing Severe
  Symptoms using Chest CT Scan</title>
    <summary>  With the rapidly worldwide spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is of
great importance to conduct early diagnosis of COVID-19 and predict the time
that patients might convert to the severe stage, for designing effective
treatment plan and reducing the clinicians' workloads. In this study, we
propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the
patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict
the possible conversion time that the patient would spend to convert to the
severe stage. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight
for each sample to reduce the outliers' influence and explore the problem of
imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity
regularization term to remove the redundant features of high-dimensional data
and learn the shared information across the classification task and the
regression task. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to predict the
disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to
deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients' lives.
Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with
422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases were converted to
severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show
that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and
regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared
to all comparison methods. Moreover, our proposed method yields 76.97% of
accuracy for predicting the severe cases, 0.524 of the correlation coefficient,
and 0.55 days difference for the converted time.

    <title>Letter to the Editor: Note on published research on the effects of
  COVID-19 on the environment without sufficient depth of science</title>
    <summary>  Dear Editor-in-Chief: We have given two articles published recently in
Science of the Total Environment by Mandal and Pal (2020) and
Zambrano-Monserrate et al. (2020) a thorough reading. Both articles present a
significant association between the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) social
distancing policies and improvement in environmental quality such as air
pollution, land surface temperature, and noise. Both articles present good
research, complemented by detailed explanations and displays, yet we have a few
concerns that affect the interpretation and meaning of the results.

    <title>Combining Visible Light and Infrared Imaging for Efficient Detection of
  Respiratory Infections such as COVID-19 on Portable Device</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious global epidemic in
the past few months and caused huge loss to human society worldwide. For such a
large-scale epidemic, early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers
is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic. Recent studies have shown that
one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by
viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce
the risk of getting sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable
non-contact method to screen the health condition of people wearing masks
through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly consists
of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those
potential patients of COVID-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection
in schools and hospitals. In this work, we perform the health screening through
the combination of the RGB and thermal videos obtained from the dual-mode
camera and deep learning architecture.We first accomplish a respiratory data
capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a
bidirectional GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the
respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of
validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on
respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7\% on the real-world dataset. The abnormal
respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin
Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other
normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people around our
researchers. This work demonstrates that the proposed portable and intelligent
health screening device can be used as a pre-scan method for respiratory
infections, which may help fight the current COVID-19 epidemic.

    <title>In the Eyes of the Beholder: Sentiment and Topic Analyses on Social
  Media Use of Neutral and Controversial Terms for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  During the COVID-19 pandemic, "Chinese Virus" emerged as a controversial term
for coronavirus. To some, it may seem like a neutral term referring to the
physical origin of the virus. To many others, however, the term is in fact
attaching ethnicity to the virus. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on
the term's real-world usage on Twitter. Using sentiment feature analysis and
topic modeling, we reveal substantial differences between the use of the
controversial terms such as "Chinese virus" and that of the non-controversial
terms such as "COVID-19". For example, tweets using controversial terms contain
a higher percentage of anger as well as negative emotions. They also point to
China more frequently. Our results suggest that while the term "Chinese virus"
could be interpreted either as neutral or racist, its usage on social media
leans strongly towards the latter.

    <title>Predicting Infection of COVID-19 in Japan: State Space Modeling Approach</title>
    <summary>  The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Japan
has been increasing day by day and has had a serious impact on the society
especially after the declaration of the state of emergency on April 7, 2020.
This study analyzes the real time data from March 1 to April 22, 2020 by
adopting a sophisticated statistical modeling tool based on the state space
model combined with the well-known susceptible-exposed-infected (SIR) model.
The model estimation and forecasting are conducted using the Bayesian
methodology. The present study provides the parameter estimates of the unknown
parameters that critically determine the epidemic process derived from the SIR
model and prediction of the future transition of the infectious proportion
including the size and timing of the epidemic peak with the prediction
intervals that naturally accounts for the uncertainty. The prediction results
under various scenarios reveals that the temporary reduction in the infection
rate until the planned lifting of the state on May 6 will only delay the
epidemic peak slightly. In order to minimize the spread of the epidemic, it is
strongly suggested that an intervention is carried out for an extended period
of time and that the government and individuals make a long term effort to
reduce the infection rate even after the lifting.

    <title>Trend analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and the rest of the
  world</title>
    <summary>  The recent epidemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19) that started in China has
already been "exported" to more than 140 countries in all the continents,
evolving in most of them by local spreading. In this contribution we analyze
the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in
some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported.
Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an
exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem
to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out
recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down
with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic
was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries
like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other
European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first
countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems
to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most
affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local
case. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give
interpretations and possible explanations for them. The analysis and
conclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases,
are not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started.

    <title>Dynamic Modeling COVID-19 for Comparing Containment Strategies in a
  Pandemic Scenario</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States has
forced federal and local governments to implement containment measures.
Moreover, the severity of the situation has sparked engagement by both the
research and clinical community with the goal of developing effective
treatments for the disease. This article proposes a time dynamic prediction
model with competing risks for the infected individual and develops a simple
tool for policy makers to compare different strategies in terms of when to
implement the strictest containment measures and how different treatments can
increase or suppress infected cases. Two types of containment strategies are
compared: (1) a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of
citizens for a long period; and (2) an adaptive containment strategy whose
strict level changes across time. We consider how an effective treatment of the
disease can affect the dynamics in a pandemic scenario. For illustration we
consider a region with population 2.8 million and 200 initial infectious cases
assuming a 4% mortality rate compared with a 2% mortality rate if a new drug is
available. Our results show compared with a constant containment strategy,
adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and reduce maximum
daily number of cases. This, along with an effective treatment plan for the
disease can minimize death rate.

    <title>Quantifying the Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Mainland China Using
  Human Mobility Data</title>
    <summary>  To contain the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Mainland China, the
authorities have put in place a series of measures, including quarantines,
social distancing, and travel restrictions. While these strategies have
effectively dealt with the critical situations of outbreaks, the combination of
the pandemic and mobility controls has slowed China's economic growth,
resulting in the first quarterly decline of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since
GDP began to be calculated, in 1992. To characterize the potential shrinkage of
the domestic economy, from the perspective of mobility, we propose two new
economic indicators: the New Venues Created (NVC) and the Volumes of Visits to
Venue (V^3), as the complementary measures to domestic investments and
consumption activities, using the data of Baidu Maps. The historical records of
these two indicators demonstrated strong correlations with the past figures of
Chinese GDP, while the status quo has dramatically changed this year, due to
the pandemic. We hereby presented a quantitative analysis to project the impact
of the pandemic on economies, using the recent trends of NVC and V^3. We found
that the most affected sectors would be travel-dependent businesses, such as
hotels, educational institutes, and public transportation, while the sectors
that are mandatory to human life, such as workplaces, residential areas,
restaurants, and shopping sites, have been recovering rapidly. Analysis at the
provincial level showed that the self-sufficient and self-sustainable economic
regions, with internal supplies, production, and consumption, have recovered
faster than those regions relying on global supply chains.

    <title>Effect of Lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 in Pakistan</title>
    <summary>  A novel coronavirus originated from Wuhan, China in late December 2019 has
now affected almost all countries worldwide. Pakistan reported its first case
in late February. The country went to lockdown after three weeks since the
first case, when the total number of cases were over 880. Pakistan imposed a
lockdown for more than a month which slowed the spread of COVID 19 effectively,
however in late April relaxation in lockdown was allowed by the government in
stages to lift the strain on the economy. In this study, the data has been
analyzed from daily situation reports by the National Institute of Health
Pakistan and the effects of initial strict lockdown and later smart lockdown
have been studied. Our analysis showed a 13.14 Percentage increase in cases
before lockdown which drops down to 6.55 percent during the lockdown. It proved
the effectiveness of lockdown. However, the Percentage Increase in case grows
up to 7.24 during a smart lockdown. If it continues to rise in this manner,
Pakistan may need to enter again into a strict second lockdown.

    <title>Design of a Low-cost Miniature Robot to Assist the COVID-19
  Nasopharyngeal Swab Sampling</title>
    <summary>  Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling is an effective approach for the diagnosis
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Medical staffs carrying out the task of
collecting NP specimens are in close contact with the suspected patient,
thereby posing a high risk of cross-infection. We propose a low-cost miniature
robot that can be easily assembled and remotely controlled. The system includes
an active end-effector, a passive positioning arm, and a detachable swab
gripper with integrated force sensing capability. The cost of the materials for
building this robot is 55 USD and the total weight of the functional part is
0.23kg. The design of the force sensing swab gripper was justified using Finite
Element (FE) modeling and the performances of the robot were validated with a
simulation phantom and three pig noses. FE analysis indicated a 0.5mm magnitude
displacement of the gripper's sensing beam, which meets the ideal detecting
range of the optoelectronic sensor. Studies on both the phantom and the pig
nose demonstrated the successful operation of the robot during the collection
task. The average forces were found to be 0.35N and 0.85N, respectively. It is
concluded that the proposed robot is promising and could be further developed
to be used in vivo.

    <title>Using Mobility for Electrical Load Forecasting During the COVID-19
  Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges
for the utilities and grid operators around the world. In this work, we focus
on the problem of load forecasting. With strict social distancing restrictions,
power consumption profiles around the world have shifted both in magnitude and
daily patterns. These changes have caused significant difficulties in
short-term load forecasting. Typically algorithms use weather, timing
information and previous consumption levels as input variables, yet they cannot
capture large and sudden changes in socioeconomic behavior during the pandemic.
In this paper, we introduce mobility as a measure of economic activities to
complement existing building blocks of forecasting algorithms. Mobility data
acts as good proxies for the population-level behaviors during the
implementation and subsequent easing of social distancing measures. The major
challenge with such dataset is that only limited mobility records are
associated with the recent pandemic. To overcome this small data problem, we
design a transfer learning scheme that enables knowledge transfer between
several different geographical regions. This architecture leverages the
diversity across these regions and the resulting aggregated model can boost the
algorithm performance in each region's day-ahead forecast. Through simulations
for regions in the US and Europe, we show our proposed algorithm can outperform
conventional forecasting methods by more than three-folds. In addition, we
demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to project how electricity
consumption would recover based on different mobility scenarios.

    <title>Data analysis on Coronavirus spreading by macroscopic growth laws</title>
    <summary>  To evaluate the effectiveness of the containment on the epidemic spreading of
the new Coronavirus disease 2019, we carry on an analysis of the time evolution
of the infection in a selected number of different Countries, by considering
well-known macroscopic growth laws, the Gompertz law, and the logistic law. We
also propose here a generalization of Gompertz law. Our data analysis permits
an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. The daily data
must be compared with the obtained fits, to verify if the spreading is under
control. From our analysis it appears that the spreading reached saturation in
China, due to the strong containment policy of the national government. In
Singapore a large growth rate, recently observed, suggests the start of a new
strong spreading. For South Korea and Italy, instead, the next data on new
infections will be crucial to understand if the saturation will be reached for
lower or higher numbers of infected individuals.

    <title>CoAID: COVID-19 Healthcare Misinformation Dataset</title>
    <summary>  As the COVID-19 virus quickly spreads around the world, unfortunately,
misinformation related to COVID-19 also gets created and spreads like wild
fire. Such misinformation has caused confusion among people, disruptions in
society, and even deadly consequences in health problems. To be able to
understand, detect, and mitigate such COVID-19 misinformation, therefore, has
not only deep intellectual values but also huge societal impacts. To help
researchers combat COVID-19 health misinformation, therefore, we present CoAID
(Covid-19 heAlthcare mIsinformation Dataset), with diverse COVID-19 healthcare
misinformation, including fake news on websites and social platforms, along
with users' social engagement about such news. CoAID includes 1,896 news,
183,564 related user engagements, 516 social platform posts about COVID-19, and
ground truth labels. The dataset is available at:

    <title>Mobile phone location data reveal the effect and geographic variation of
  social distancing on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19)
has become a pandemic. Social (physical) distancing is a key non-pharmacologic
control measure to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2, but high-level
adherence is needed. Using daily travel distance and stay-at-home time derived
from large-scale anonymous mobile phone location data provided by Descartes
Labs and SafeGraph, we quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates
have been followed in the U.S. and its effect on growth of COVID-19 cases. The
correlation between the COVID-19 growth rate and travel distance decay rate and
dwell time at home change rate was -0.586 (95% CI: -0.742 ~ -0.370) and 0.526
(95% CI: 0.293 ~ 0.700), respectively. Increases in state-specific doubling
time of total cases ranged from 1.04 ~ 6.86 days to 3.66 ~ 30.29 days after
social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with mechanistic
epidemic prediction models. Social distancing mandates reduce the spread of
COVID-19 when they are followed.

    <title>Modeling the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Brazil: results from a
  Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model</title>
    <summary>  The world evolution of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-Cov2 or simply COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare it
a pandemic. The disease appeared in China in December 2019, and it has spread
fast around the world, specially in european countries like Italy and Spain.
The first reported case in Brazil was recorded in February 26, and after that
the number of cases growed fast. In order to slow down the initial growth of
the disease through the country, confirmed positive cases were isolated to not
transmit the disease. To better understand the early evolution of COVID-19 in
Brazil, we apply a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model to
the analysis of data from the Brazilian Department of Health, obtained from
February 26, 2020 through March 25, 2020. Based on analyical and numerical
results, as well on the data, the basic reproduction number is estimated to
$R_{0}=5.25$. In addition, we estimate that the ratio unidentified infectious
individuals and confirmed cases at the beginning of the epidemic is about $10$,
in agreement with previous studies. We also estimated the epidemic doubling
time to be $2.72$ days.

    <title>The CoRisk-Index: A data-mining approach to identify industry-specific
  risk assessments related to COVID-19 in real-time</title>
    <summary>  While the coronavirus spreads, governments are attempting to reduce contagion
rates at the expense of negative economic effects. Market expectations
plummeted, foreshadowing the risk of a global economic crisis and mass
unemployment. Governments provide huge financial aid programmes to mitigate the
economic shocks. To achieve higher effectiveness with such policy measures, it
is key to identify the industries that are most in need of support. In this
study, we introduce a data-mining approach to measure industry-specific risks
related to COVID-19. We examine company risk reports filed to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This alternative data set can
complement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving
crisis as it allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments. Preliminary
findings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business
risks is ahead of the overall stock market developments. Our approach allows to
distinguish the industries by their risk awareness towards COVID-19. Based on
natural language processing, we identify corona-related risk topics and their
perceived relevance for different industries. The preliminary findings are
summarised as an up-to-date online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the
industry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis, as it spreads through
the economy. The tracking tool is updated weekly. It could provide relevant
empirical data to inform models on the economic effects of the crisis. Such
complementary empirical information could ultimately help policymakers to
effectively target financial support in order to mitigate the economic shocks
of the crisis.

    <title>The effect of stay-at-home orders on COVID-19 cases and fatalities in
  the United States</title>
    <summary>  Governments issue "stay at home" orders to reduce the spread of contagious
diseases, but the magnitude of such orders' effectiveness is uncertain. In the
United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity
to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect with
greater accuracy. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders
with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level in the
United States. We estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders using a
difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation
in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal
variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests.
Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results
show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2)
reduction in weekly cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0)
reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after
three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3
to 80.2) reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. These results
suggest that stay-at-home orders reduced confirmed cases by 390,000 (170,000 to
680,000) and fatalities by 41,000 (27,000 to 59,000) within the first three
weeks in localities where they were implemented.

    <title>Monitoring COVID-19 social distancing with person detection and tracking
  via fine-tuned YOLO v3 and Deepsort techniques</title>
    <summary>  The rampant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought global crisis
with its deadly spread to more than 180 countries, and about 3,519,901
confirmed cases along with 247,630 deaths globally as on May 4, 2020. The
absence of any active therapeutic agents and the lack of immunity against
COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of the population. Since there are no
vaccines available, social distancing is the only feasible approach to fight
against this pandemic. Motivated by this notion, this article proposes a deep
learning based framework for automating the task of monitoring social
distancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLO
v3 object detection model to segregate humans from the background and Deepsort
approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes and
assigned IDs. The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared with other
popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution
neural network) and single shot detector (SSD) in terms of mean average
precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object
classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is
computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the
centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index
term is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol.
From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort
tracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score to
monitor the social distancing in real-time.

    <title>Feeling Like It is Time to Reopen Now? COVID-19 New Normal Scenarios
  based on Reopening Sentiment Analytics</title>
    <summary>  The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse
circumstances. This research discovers public sentiment amidst problematic
socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential
sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led
to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare
challenges. This research identifies emotional consequences - the presence of
extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and
anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for
effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using
Twitter Data, time-aligned to COVID-19, to identify dominant sentiment trends
associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual
analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential
divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences
of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual
analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American
Twitter users shows more trust sentiment support, than fear, for reopening the
US economy. With additional validation, this could present a valuable time
sensitive opportunity for state governments, the federal government,
corporations and societal leaders to guide the nation into a successful new
normal future.

    <title>COVID-ABS: An Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 Epidemic to Simulate Health
  and Economic Effects of Social Distancing Interventions</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus have directly
impacted the public health and economy. To overcome this problem, the countries
have adopted different policies for controlling the spread of the virus. This
paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR agent-based model that aims to
simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people,
business and government. Seven different scenarios varying epidemiological and
economical effects of social distance interventions were performed, which are:
(1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation,
(5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks
together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of
implementing scenarios with lockdown which present the lowest number of deaths
and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks
and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of
social cooperation. The model can be easily extended to new societies by
varying the parameters as well as allows the creating of a multitude of other
scenarios.

    <title>COVID-19 forecasting based on an improved interior search algorithm and
  multi-layer feed forward neural network</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was emerged in December 2019 within
Wuhan, China. As the crisis of its serious increasing dynamic outbreak in all
parts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis of confirmed cases (CS)
becomes a vital great changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model
is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days
based on the reported data since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model,
named ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based
on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi-layer feed-forward neural
network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the
performance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this
methodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its
parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding
forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data
of the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the
confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed
forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices
including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization
algorithms are presented. The proposed model is investigated in the most
affected countries (i.e., USA, Italy, and Spain). The experimental simulations
illustrate that the proposed ISACL-MFNN provides promising performance rather
than the other algorithms while forecasting task for the candidate countries.

    <title>Computational modeling of Human-nCoV protein-protein interaction network</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has created a global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality in
2020. Novel coronavirus (nCoV), also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is responsible for this deadly disease.
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has declared that nCoV is
highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 (89% similarity).
Limited number of clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is
available in the literature. With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on
developing a computational model for nCoV-Human protein interaction network,
using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions.
Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in
SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) model. These proteins are considered as potential human targets for nCoV
bait proteins. A gene-ontology based fuzzy affinity function has been used to
construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at 99.98% specificity
threshold. This also identifies the level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in
human protein-interaction network. Level-2 human spreaders are subsequently
identified using the SIS model. The derived host-pathogen interaction network
is finally validated using 7 potential FDA listed drugs for COVID-19 with
significant overlap between the known drug target proteins and the identified
spreader proteins.

    <title>Control Efficacy on COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We proposed a Monte-Carlo method to estimate temporal reproduction number
without complete information about symptom onsets of all cases. Province-level
analysis demonstrated the huge success of Chinese control measures on COVID-19,
that is, provinces' reproduction numbers quickly decrease to &lt;1 by just one
week after taking actions.

    <title>Anonymous Collocation Discovery: Harnessing Privacy to Tame the
  Coronavirus</title>
    <summary>  Successful containment of the Coronavirus pandemic rests on the ability to
quickly and reliably identify those who have been in close proximity to a
contagious individual. Existing tools for doing so rely on the collection of
exact location information of individuals over lengthy time periods, and
combining this information with other personal information. This unprecedented
encroachment on individual privacy at national scales has created an outcry and
risks rejection of these tools.
  We propose an alternative: an extremely simple scheme for providing
fine-grained and timely alerts to users who have been in the close vicinity of
an infected individual. Crucially, this is done while preserving the anonymity
of all individuals, and without collecting or storing any personal information
or location history. Our approach is based on using short-range communication
mechanisms, like Bluetooth, that are available in all modern cell phones. It
can be deployed with very little infrastructure, and incurs a relatively low
false-positive rate compared to other collocation methods. We also describe a
number of extensions and tradeoffs.
  We believe that the privacy guarantees provided by the scheme will encourage
quick and broad voluntary adoption. When combined with sufficient testing
capacity and existing best practices from healthcare professionals, we hope
that this may significantly reduce the infection rate.

    <title>Synergistic Learning of Lung Lobe Segmentation and Hierarchical
  Multi-Instance Classification for Automated Severity Assessment of COVID-19
  in CT Images</title>
    <summary>  Understanding chest CT imaging of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
will help detect infections early and assess the disease progression.
Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an
essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive
clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the
severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the
lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this
end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity
assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe
segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few
infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we
first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image
patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance
deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of
COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet
consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe
segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a
unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context
information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the
performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a
real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results
suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several
state-of-the-art methods.

    <title>Impact of intervention on the spread of COVID-19 in India: A model based
  study</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already
created emergency situations in almost every country of the world. The disease
spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first
identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreaks
starts on $2^{nd}$ March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing
exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific
medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission
mechanism of the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease
properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease
dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in
reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to
describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We
consider the initial phase of the outbreak situation in India and our proposed
model is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported cases during the period
$2^{nd}$ March, 2020 to $24^{th}$ March, 2020. We estimate the basic
reproduction number $(R_0)$, effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemic
doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We
further assess the effect of preventive measures such as spread of awareness,
lock-down, proper hand sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Two
intervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the
intervention strength over the period of implementation. Our study suggests
that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak
within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
the strength of the intervention should be strengthened over the time to
eradicate the disease effectively.

    <title>A model for COVID-19 with isolation, quarantine and testing as control
  measures</title>
    <summary>  In this article we propose a compartmental model for the dynamics of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We take into account the presence of
asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to
contain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the
population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by
separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep
working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group
consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. We refer to
quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases.
In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of
contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in
time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an
explicit expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ in terms
of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we
can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the
epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic
scenarios. From the expression of $\mathcal{R}_0$ and the simulations we
conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic
cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, {and the stricter these
measures are and the sooner they are implemented,} the more lives can be saved.
Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce
their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to
maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.

    <title>On a quarantine model of coronavirus infection and data analysis</title>
    <summary>  Attempts to curb the spread of coronavirus by introducing strict quarantine
measures apparently have different effect in different countries: while the
number of new cases has reportedly decreased in China and South Korea, it still
exhibit significant growth in Italy and other countries across Europe. In this
brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by
means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we
introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all
infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that
they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is
determined by the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of
newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different
compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\mathcal{R}_0 &gt;1$, then the
number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if
$\mathcal{R}_0 &lt;1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions
imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays
exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development
in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth
dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth).
Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection
(maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting
measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the
total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate
remains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced
quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.

    <title>Isothermal evaporation rate of deposited liquid aerosols and the
  SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus survival</title>
    <summary>  It is shown that the evaporation rate of a liquid sample containing the
culture of coronavirus affects its survival on a substrate. Possible mechanisms
of such influence can be due to the appearance of large, about 140 bar, non
comprehensive capillary pressures and the associated dynamic forces during the
movement of the evaporation front in a sample with the virus. A simulation of
isothermal evaporation of a thin liquid sample based on the Stefan problem was
performed. The comparison of simulation data and recent experiments on the
coronavirus survival on various surfaces showed that the rate of isothermal
evaporation of aqueous samples, which is higher for heat-conducting materials,
correlates well with the lifetime of the coronavirus on these surfaces.

    <summary>  We study observed incidence of self-disclosure in a large dataset of Tweets
representing user-led English-language conversation about the Coronavirus
pandemic in the month between March 1 and April 3, 2020. Using an unsupervised
approach to detection of voluntary disclosure of personal information, we
provide early evidence that situational factors surrounding the Coronavirus
pandemic may impact individuals' privacy calculus. Text analyses reveal topical
shift toward supportiveness and support-seeking in self-disclosing conversation
on Twitter. We run a comparable analysis of Tweets from Hurricane Harvey to
provide context for observed effects and suggest opportunities for further
study.

    <title>Piecewise quadratic growth during the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic</title>
    <summary>  The temporal growth in the number of deaths in the COVID-19 epidemic is
subexponential. Here we show that a piecewise quadratic law provides an
excellent fit during the thirty days after the first three fatalities on
January 20 and later since the end of March 2020. There is also a brief
intermediate period of exponential growth. During the second quadratic growth
phase, the characteristic time of the growth is about eight times shorter than
in the beginning, which can be understood as the occurrence of separate
hotspots. Quadratic behavior can be motivated by peripheral growth when further
spreading occurs only on the outskirts of an infected region. We also study
numerical solutions of a simple epidemic model, where the spatial extend of the
system is taken into account. To model the delayed onset outside China together
with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we
adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation
much earlier than the others. At each site, quadratic growth commences when the
local number of infections has reached a certain saturation level. The total
number of deaths does then indeed follow a piecewise quadratic behavior.

    <title>Protocol for an Observational Study on the Effects of Social Distancing
  on Influenza-Like Illness and COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory
disease that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since
spread around the globe, claiming more than 69,000 lives by the time this
protocol is written. It has been widely acknowledged that the most effective
public policy to mitigate the pandemic is \emph{social and physical
distancing}: keeping at least six feet away from people, working from home,
closing non-essential businesses, etc. There have been a lot of anecdotal
evidences suggesting that social distancing has a causal effect on disease
mitigation; however, few studies have investigated the effect of social
distancing on disease mitigation in a transparent and statistically-sound
manner.
  We propose to perform an optimal non-bipartite matching to pair counties with
similar observed covariates but vastly different average social distancing
scores during the first week (March 16th through Match 22nd) of President's
\emph{15 Days to Slow the Spread} campaign. We have produced a total of $302$
pairs of two U.S. counties with good covariate balance on a total of $16$
important variables. Our primary outcome will be the average observed illness
collected by Kinsa Inc. two weeks after the intervention period. Although the
observed illness does not directly measure COVID-19, it reflects a real-time
aspect of the pandemic, and unlike confirmed cases, it is much less confounded
by counties' testing capabilities. We also consider observed illness three
weeks after the intervention period as a secondary outcome. We will test a
proportional treatment effect using a randomization-based test with covariance
adjustment and conduct a sensitivity analysis.

    <title>Identifying the measurements required to estimate rates of COVID-19
  transmission, infection, and detection, using variational data assimilation</title>
    <summary>  We demonstrate the ability of statistical data assimilation to identify the
measurements required for accurate state and parameter estimation in an
epidemiological model for the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. Our context
is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on
hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying
transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization,
and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and
symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain accurate estimates of undetected
(that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases
together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the
detection rates. These state estimates require a measurement of the recovered
population, and are tolerant to low errors in that measurement. Further,
excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of
112 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times
prior to the implementation of social distancing. The estimation of this
transmission rate is sensitive to contamination in the data, highlighting the
need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. Finally, we employ the
procedure using real data from Italy reported by Johns Hopkins. The aim of this
paper is not to assign extreme significance to the results of these specific
experiments \textit{per se}. Rather, we intend to exemplify the power of SDA to
determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown model
parameters to a desired precision - all set within the complex context of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>How does Working from Home Affect Developer Productivity? -- A Case
  Study of Baidu During COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays, working from home (WFH) has become a popular work arrangement due
to its many potential benefits for both companies and employees (e.g.,
increasing job satisfaction and retention of employees). Many previous studies
have investigated the impact of working from home on the productivity of
employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis
method such as survey and interview, and the studied participants do not work
from home for a long continuing time. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to
work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether working
from home affects their productivity.
  In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity
between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative
analysis based on a dataset of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one
of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four
thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working days. Out of
these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due
to COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts
on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of
builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working from home has
different impacts on projects with different characteristics including
programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has
a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally,
we find that productivity varies for different developers. Based on these
findings, we get some feedbacks from developers of Baidu and understand some
reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity.

    <title>Abnormal respiratory patterns classifier may contribute to large-scale
  screening of people infected with COVID-19 in an accurate and unobtrusive
  manner</title>
    <summary>  Research significance: During the epidemic prevention and control period, our
study can be helpful in prognosis, diagnosis and screening for the patients
infected with COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) based on breathing
characteristics. According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory
pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the
common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea.
People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be
utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be
preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in
situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research
details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of
people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work,
we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this
goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is
not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of
different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation
is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory
signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first
proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce
real-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with
bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify 6 clinically
significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots,
Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea). The proposed deep model and the modeling
ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such
as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.

    <title>A Big Data Based Framework for Executing Complex Query Over COVID-19
  Datasets (COVID-QF)</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19's rapid global spread has driven innovative tools for Big Data
Analytics. These have guided organizations in all fields of the health industry
to track and minimized the effects of virus. Researchers are required to detect
coronaviruses through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural
language processing, and to gain a complete understanding of the disease.
COVID-19 takes place in different countries in the world, with which only big
data application and the work of NOSQL databases are suitable. There is a great
number of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases model like: Spark, H2O
and Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous
amount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers,
especially those that work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models
through different APIs and query. In this context, this paper proposes a
storage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF) for
COVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus
spreading worldwide by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database,
COVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of
three Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer.
The data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides
data into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the
Connector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving
and retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends
results. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for
COVID-19 data (COVID-19-Merging, COVID-19-inside-Hubei and COVID-19-ex-Hubei)
to test experiments of this study. The results obtained insure the superiority
of the COVID-QF framework.

    <title>CovidAID: COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Ray</title>
    <summary>  The exponential increase in COVID-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare
systems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every
patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques
(RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity.
Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high
risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already
available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems
already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples
either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the
selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an
inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to
keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in
COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood
of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further,
we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients
using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where
radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology
scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural
network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly
available covid-chestxray-dataset [2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100%
sensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection. We significantly improve upon
the results of Covid-Net [10] on the same dataset.

    <title>An Improved Method for the Fitting and Prediction of the Number of
  COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Based on LSTM</title>
    <summary>  New coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has constituted a global pandemic and has
spread to most countries and regions in the world. By understanding the
development trend of a regional epidemic, the epidemic can be controlled using
the development policy. The common traditional mathematical differential
equations and population prediction models have limitations for time series
population prediction, and even have large estimation errors. To address this
issue, we propose an improved method for predicting confirmed cases based on
LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) neural network. This work compared the deviation
between the experimental results of the improved LSTM prediction model and the
digital prediction models (such as Logistic and Hill equations) with the real
data as reference. And this work uses the goodness of fitting to evaluate the
fitting effect of the improvement. Experiments show that the proposed approach
has a smaller prediction deviation and a better fitting effect. Compared with
the previous forecasting methods, the contributions of our proposed improvement
methods are mainly in the following aspects: 1) we have fully considered the
spatiotemporal characteristics of the data, rather than single standardized
data; 2) the improved parameter settings and evaluation indicators are more
accurate for fitting and forecasting. 3) we consider the impact of the epidemic
stage and conduct reasonable data processing for different stage.

    <title>Identification of an Epidemiological Model to Simulate the COVID-19
  Epidemic using Robust Multi-objective Optimization and Stochastic Fractal
  Search</title>
    <summary>  Traditionally, the identification of parameters in the formulation and
solution of inverse problems considers that models, variables and mathematical
parameters are free of uncertainties. This aspect simplifies the estimation
process, but does not consider the influence of relatively small changes in the
design variables in terms of the objective function. In this work, the SIDR
(Susceptible, Infected, Dead and Recovered) model is used to simulate the
dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and its
parameters are estimated by formulating a robust inverse problem, that is,
considering the sensitivity of design variables. For this purpose, a robust
multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, considering the
minimization of uncertainties associated to the estimation process and the
maximization of the robustness parameter. To solve this problem, the
Multi-objective Stochastic Fractal Search algorithm is associated with the
Effective Mean concept for the evaluation of robustness. The results obtained
considering real data of the epidemic in China demonstrate that the evaluation
of the sensitivity of the design variables can provide more reliable results.

    <title>The Impact of Public Safety Measures on the Spread of COVID-19 in the
  United States Assessed By Causal Model-Based Projections of the Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes, COVID-19 was
declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization. Since
then, the disease has spread all over the world, with the United States
becoming the country with the highest number of cases. Governments around the
world have undertaken varying degrees of public safety measures, including
recommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices, enacting
social distancing requirements and limiting large public gatherings, and
stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In the United States, while the response has
varied greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect of these
public safety measures is significant and, if these measures continue to remain
in effect, or are expanded to a nationwide lockdown, the pandemic can be
controlled and the disease likely overcome with mitigated consequences. In this
paper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model. We
find that, with continued lockdown measures, the United States can, according
to this model, limit the total number of infections to ~1.35 million and the
total number of deaths to ~72 thousand. A 60 day lockdown can save countless
lives.

    <title>Data-Driven Modeling Reveals the Impact of Stay-at-Home Orders on Human
  Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the U.S</title>
    <summary>  One approach to delay the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is to
reduce human travel by imposing travel restriction policies. It is yet unclear
how effective those policies are on suppressing the mobility trend due to the
lack of ground truth and large-scale dataset describing human mobility during
the pandemic. This study uses real-world location-based service data collected
from anonymized mobile devices to uncover mobility changes during COVID-19 and
under the 'Stay-at-home' state orders in the U.S. The study measures human
mobility with two important metrics: daily average number of trips per person
and daily average person-miles traveled. The data-driven analysis and modeling
attribute less than 5% of the reduction in the number of trips and person-miles
traveled to the effect of the policy. The models developed in the study exhibit
high prediction accuracy and can be applied to inform epidemics modeling with
empirically verified mobility trends and to support time-sensitive
decision-making processes.

    <title>The Covid-19 pandemic's effects on poor rural dwellers in sub-Saharan
  Africa: A case study of access to basic clean water, sanitary systems and
  hand-washing facilities</title>
    <summary>  The fear of the invisible but prevalent Coronavirus (COVID-19), disease
cannot be overemphasized since there is the potential possibility of it wiping
out the entire world population within a few months if adequate and quick steps
are not taken to curb this menace, and the sub-Saharan African (SSAn) region is
no exception. It is evident that water, as an essential daily commodity, has
long been in a state of emergency in SSAn nations, which is largely attributed
to decades of neglect by the successive governments, because it has not been
possible to separate the existing bond between water, health, livelihood and
the economy. The laudable Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) proposed by the
United Nations had yet to achieve the stated objective of improving the
standards of living and health conditions of the rural communities in the SSAn
region before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This failure has been masked by a
sort of delusion in which the people of this region are subjected to the
hardship of searching for clean and healthy water in their own ponds, rivers,
streams and shallow hand-dug local wells on a continuous basis. Less than 17%
of the rural population in all the SSAn communities can access basic
hand-washing facilities and sanitation systems. The total water productivity,
as measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per cubic meter of total
freshwater withdrawn, for the people was less than 5 GDP.

    <title>Testing Case Number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China with
  Newcomb-Benford Law</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 bursted out about two months ago in Wuhan has
caused the death of more than a thousand people. China is fighting hard against
the epidemics with the helps from all over the world. On the other hand, there
appear to be doubts on the reported case number. In this article, we propose a
test of the reported case number of coronavirus disease 2019 in China with
Newcomb-Benford law. We find a $p$-value of $92.8\%$ in favour that the
cumulative case numbers abide by the Newcomb-Benford law. Even though the
reported case number can be lower than the real number of affected people due
to various reasons, this test does not seem to indicate the detection of
frauds.

    <title>Coronavirus Geographic Dissemination at Chicago and its Potential
  Proximity to Public Commuter Rail</title>
    <summary>  The community spread of coronavirus at great Chicago area has severely
threatened the residents health, family and normal activities. CDC daily
updates on infected cases on County level are not satisfying to address publics
concern on virus spread. On March 20th, NBC5 published case information of 435
coronavirus infections. The data is relative comprehensive and of high value
for understanding on the virus spread patterns at Chicago. Data engineering,
natural language processing and Google map technology are applied to organize
the data and retrieve geographic information of the virus. The analysis shows
community spread in Chicago areas has a potential proximity relation with
public commuter rail. Residents nearby major public commuter rails need limit
outdoor activities during the outbreak and even the post-peak time.

    <title>The Hypothesis of Testing: Paradoxes arising out of reported coronavirus
  case-counts</title>
    <summary>  Many statisticians, epidemiologists, economists and data scientists have
registered serious reservations regarding the reported coronavirus case-counts.
Limited testing capacity across the country has been widely identified as a key
driver of suppressed coronavirus case-counts. The calls to increase testing
capacity are well-justified as they become a more frequent point of discussion
in the public sphere. While expanded testing is a laudable goal, selection bias
will impact estimates of disease prevalence and the effective reproduction
number until the entire population is sampled. Moreover, tests are imperfect as
false positive/negative rates interact in complex ways with selection bias. In
this paper, we attempt to clarify this interaction. Through simple
calculations, we demonstrate pitfalls and paradoxes that can arise when
considering case-count data in the presence of selection bias and measurement
error. The discussion guides several suggestions on how to improve current
case-count reporting.

    <title>Forecast of the evolution of the contagious disease caused by novel
  coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has caused a viral
epidemic affecting tens of thousands of persons. Though the danger of this
epidemic is evident, the statistical analysis of data offered in this paper
indicates that the increase in new cases in China will stabilize in the coming
days or weeks. Our forecast could serve to evaluate risks and control the
evolution of this disease.

    <title>A Quantitative Portrait of Wikipedia's High-Tempo Collaborations during
  the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The 2020 coronavirus pandemic was a historic social disruption with
significant consequences felt around the globe. Wikipedia is a
freely-available, peer-produced encyclopedia with a remarkable ability to
create and revise content following current events. Using 973,940 revisions
from 134,337 editors to 4,238 articles, this study examines the dynamics of the
English Wikipedia's response to the coronavirus pandemic through the first five
months of 2020 as a "quantitative portrait" describing the emergent
collaborative behavior at three levels of analysis: article revision, editor
contributions, and network dynamics. Across multiple data sources, quantitative
methods, and levels of analysis, we find four consistent themes characterizing
Wikipedia's unique large-scale, high-tempo, and temporary online
collaborations: external events as drivers of activity, spillovers of activity,
complex patterns of editor engagement, and the shadows of the future. In light
of increasing concerns about online social platforms' abilities to govern the
conduct and content of their users, we identify implications from Wikipedia's
coronavirus collaborations for improving the resilience of socio-technical
systems during a crisis.

    <title>Transcriptional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infection dismantles pathogenic
  pathways activated by the virus, proposes unique sex-specific differences and
  predicts tailored therapeutic strategies</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global health. As
no specific therapeutics are yet available to control disease evolution, more
in-depth understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 will
help to characterize new targets for the management of COVID-19. The present
study identified a specific set of biological pathways altered in primary human
lung epithelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a comparison with SARS-CoV from
the 2003 pandemic was studied. The transcriptomic profiles were also exploited
as possible novel therapeutic targets, and anti-signature perturbation analysis
predicted potential drugs to control disease progression. Among them,
Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), serine-threonine kinase (AKT),
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and I kappa B Kinase (IKK) inhibitors
emerged as candidate drugs. Finally, sex-specific differences that may underlie
the higher COVID-19 mortality in men are proposed.

    <title>Similarities and Evolutionary Relationships of COVID-19 and Related
  Viruses</title>
    <summary>  Today, we are all threatened by an unprecedented pandemic: COVID-19. How
different is it from other coronaviruses? Will it be attenuated or become more
virulent? Which animals may be its original host? In this study, we analyzed
377 publicly available complete genome sequences for the COVID-19 virus, the
previously known flu-causing coronaviruses (HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and
HCov-HKU1) and the lethal, pathogenic viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria, Lassa,
Yamagata, Ebola, and Dengue. We found strong similarities between the current
circulating COVID-19 and SARS and MERS, as well as COVID-19 in rhinolophines
and pangolins. On the contrary, COVID-19 shares little similarity with the
flu-causing coronaviruses and the other known viruses. Strikingly, we observed
divergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increased
from December 2019 to March 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is actively evolving in
human hosts. From all existing human COVID-19 genome sequences, we calculated
the first common model that represents the shared sequences of the human
COVID-19 strains, which provides important information for vaccine and antibody
development. Geographic and time -course analysis of the evolutionary trees of
the human COVID-19 reveals possible evolutional paths among strains from 21
countries. This finding has important implications to the management of
COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.

    <title>Open Data Resources for Fighting COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We provide an insight into the open data resources pertinent to the study of
the spread of Covid-19 pandemic and its control. We identify the variables
required to analyze fundamental aspects like seasonal behaviour, regional
mortality rates, and effectiveness of government measures. Open data resources,
along with data-driven methodologies, provide many opportunities to improve the
response of the different administrations to the virus. We describe the present
limitations and difficulties encountered in most of the open-data resources. To
facilitate the access to the main open-data portals and resources, we identify
the most relevant institutions, at a world scale, providing Covid-19
information and/or auxiliary variables (demographics, mobility, etc.). We also
describe several open resources to access Covid-19 data-sets at a country-wide
level (i.e. China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, U.S., etc.). In an attempt to
facilitate the rapid response to the study of the seasonal behaviour of
Covid-19, we enumerate the main open resources in terms of weather and climate
variables. CONCO-Team: The authors of this paper belong to the CONtrol COvid-19
Team, which is composed of different researches from universities of Spain,
Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom and Argentina. The main goal of
CONCO-Team is to develop data-driven methods for the better understanding and
control of the pandemic.

    <title>COVID-Twitter-BERT: A Natural Language Processing Model to Analyse
  COVID-19 Content on Twitter</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we release COVID-Twitter-BERT (CT-BERT), a transformer-based
model, pretrained on a large corpus of Twitter messages on the topic of
COVID-19. Our model shows a 10-30% marginal improvement compared to its base
model, BERT-Large, on five different classification datasets. The largest
improvements are on the target domain. Pretrained transformer models, such as
CT-BERT, are trained on a specific target domain and can be used for a wide
variety of natural language processing tasks, including classification,
question-answering and chatbots. CT-BERT is optimised to be used on COVID-19
content, in particular social media posts from Twitter.

    <title>Tracking COVID-19 by Tracking Infectious Trajectories</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays, the coronavirus pandemic has and is still causing large numbers of
deaths and infected people. Although governments all over the world have taken
severe measurements to slow down the virus spreading (e.g., travel
restrictions, suspending all sportive, social, and economic activities,
quarantines, social distancing, etc.), a lot of persons have died and a lot
more are still in danger. Indeed, a recently conducted study~\cite{ref2} has
reported that 79\% of the confirmed infections in China were caused by
undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous
other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of
symptoms, it has also been reported that the known number of infections is not
representative of the real number of infected people (the actual number is
expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main
factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major
reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To
contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT
(Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to
spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the
authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if
they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all
persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients.
Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control
over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.

    <title>India nudges to contain COVID-19 pandemic: a reactive public policy
  analysis using machine-learning based topic modelling</title>
    <summary>  India locked down 1.3 billion people on March 25, 2020 in the wake of
COVID-19 pandemic. The economic cost of it was estimated at USD 98 billion,
while the social costs are still unknown. This study investigated how
government formed reactive policies to fight coronavirus across its policy
sectors. Primary data was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) in
the form press releases of government plans, policies, programme initiatives
and achievements. A text corpus of 260,852 words was created from 396 documents
from the PIB. An unsupervised machine-based topic modelling using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was performed on the text corpus. It was
done to extract high probability topics in the policy sectors. The
interpretation of the extracted topics was made through a nudge theoretic lens
to derive the critical policy heuristics of the government. Results showed that
most interventions were targeted to generate endogenous nudge by using external
triggers. Notably, the nudges from the Prime Minister of India was critical in
creating herd effect on lockdown and social distancing norms across the nation.
A similar effect was also observed around the public health (e.g., masks in
public spaces; Yoga and Ayurveda for immunity), transport (e.g., old trains
converted to isolation wards), micro, small and medium enterprises (e.g., rapid
production of PPE and masks), science and technology sector (e.g., diagnostic
kits, robots and nano-technology), home affairs (e.g., surveillance and
lockdown), urban (e.g. drones, GIS-tools) and education (e.g., online
learning). A conclusion was drawn on leveraging these heuristics are crucial
for lockdown easement planning.

    <title>Quarantine Fatigue: first-ever decrease in social distancing measures
  after the COVID-19 outbreak before reopening United States</title>
    <summary>  By the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China,
and its rapid outbreak worldwide, the infectious illness has changed our
everyday travel patterns. In this research, our team investigated the changes
in the daily mobility pattern of people during the pandemic by utilizing an
integrated data panel. To incorporate various aspects of human mobility, the
team focused on the Social Distancing Index (SDI) which was calculated based on
five basic mobility measures. The SDI patterns showed a plateau stage in the
beginning of April that lasted for about two weeks. This phenomenon then
followed by a universal decline of SDI, increased number of trips and reduction
in percentage of people staying at home. We called the observation Quarantine
Fatigue. The Rate of Change (ROC) method was employed to trace back the start
date of quarantine fatigue which was indicated to be April 15th. Our analysis
showed that despite the existence of state-to-state variations, most states
started experiencing a quarantine fatigue phenomenon during the same period.
This observation became more important by knowing that none of the states had
officially announced the reopening until late April showing that people decided
to loosen up their social distancing practices before the official reopening
announcement. Moreover, our analysis indicated that official reopening led to a
rapid decline in SDI, raising the concern of a second wave of outbreak. The
synchronized trend among states also emphasizes the importance of a more
nationwide decision-making attitude for the future as the condition of each
state depends on the nationwide behavior.

    <title>Building a COVID-19 Vulnerability Index</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a
pandemic by the World Health Organization. Information regarding this
particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality
rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions.
Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe
complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in
mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19
is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory
infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at
the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such
complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive
effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.

    <title>Controlling the Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other cities in
China in 2019 has become a global pandemic as declared by World Health
Organization (WHO) in the first quarter of 2020 . The delay in diagnosis,
limited hospital resources and other treatment resources leads to rapid spread
of COVID-19. In this article, we consider an optimal control COVID-19
transmission model and assess the impact of some control measures that can lead
to the reduction of exposed and infectious individuals in the population. We
investigate three control strategies for this deadly infectious disease using
personal protection, treatment with early diagnosis, treatment with delay
diagnosis and spraying of virus in the environment as time-dependent control
functions in our dynamical model to curb the disease spread.

    <title>Combining PCR and CT testing for COVID</title>
    <summary>  We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of
potential COVID-19 infections in order to isolate and perform contact tracing
based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is then used for continued
isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates and
rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The
reduction in cases after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening
compared to PCR by itself is as high as $50\times$, and the reduction of
effective reproduction rate $R(t)$ is $0.20$. Our results imply that much more
rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with
CT-scans and contact tracing.

    <title>The COVID-19 Social Media Infodemic</title>
    <summary>  We address the diffusion of information about the COVID-19 with a massive
data analysis on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit and Gab. We analyze
engagement and interest in the COVID-19 topic and provide a differential
assessment on the evolution of the discourse on a global scale for each
platform and their users. We fit information spreading with epidemic models
characterizing the basic reproduction numbers $R_0$ for each social media
platform. Moreover, we characterize information spreading from questionable
sources, finding different volumes of misinformation in each platform. However,
information from both reliable and questionable sources do not present
different spreading patterns. Finally, we provide platform-dependent numerical
estimates of rumors' amplification.

    <title>Projected Development of COVID-19 in Louisiana</title>
    <summary>  At the time of writing, Louisiana has the third highest COVID-19 infection
per capita in the United States. The state government issued a stay-at-home
order effective March 23rd. We analyze the projected spread of COVID-19 in
Louisiana without including the effects of the stay-at-home order. We predict
that a large fraction of the state population would be infected without the
mitigation efforts, and would certainly overwhelm the capacity of Louisiana
health care system. We further predict the outcomes with different degrees of
reduction in the infection rate. More than 70% of reduction is required to cap
the number of infected to under one million.

    <title>The Flow Physics of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Flow physics plays a key role in nearly every facet of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This includes the generation and aerosolization of virus-laden respiratory
droplets from a host, its airborne dispersion and deposition on surfaces, as
well as the subsequent inhalation of these bioaerosols by unsuspecting
recipients. Fluid dynamics is also key to preventative measures such as the use
of face masks, hand-washing, ventilation of indoor environments, and even
social distancing. This article summarizes what we know, and more importantly,
what we need to learn about the science underlying these issues so that we are
better prepared to tackle the next outbreak of COVID-19 or a similar disease.

    <title>An Exploratory Characterization of Bugs in COVID-19 Software Projects</title>
    <summary>  Context: The dire consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced
development of COVID-19 software i.e., software used for analysis and
mitigation of COVID-19. Bugs in COVID-19 software can be consequential, as
COVID-19 software projects can impact public health policy and user data
privacy. Objective: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners and
researchers improve the quality of COVID-19 software through an empirical study
of open source software projects related to COVID-19. Methodology: We use 129
open source COVID-19 software projects hosted on GitHub to conduct our
empirical study. Next, we apply qualitative analysis on 550 bug reports from
the collected projects to identify bug categories. Findings: We identify 8 bug
categories, which include data bugs i.e., bugs that occur during mining and
storage of COVID-19 data. The identified bug categories appear for 7 categories
of software projects including (i) projects that use statistical modeling to
perform predictions related to COVID-19, and (ii) medical equipment software
that are used to design and implement medical equipment, such as ventilators.
Conclusion: Based on our findings, we advocate for robust statistical model
construction through better synergies between data science practitioners and
public health experts. Existence of security bugs in user tracking software
necessitates development of tools that will detect data privacy violations and
security weaknesses.

    <title>First attempts to model the dynamics of the Coronavirus outbreak 2020</title>
    <summary>  Since the end of 2019 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, called
2019--nCoV, is reported from China and later other parts of the world. Since
January 21, WHO reports daily data on confirmed cases and deaths from both
China and other countries. In this work we present some discrete and continuous
models to discribe the disease dynamics in China and estimate the needed
epidemiological parameters. Good agreement with the current dynamics has be
found for both a discrete transmission model and a slightly modified SIR-model.

    <title>SIR Model-based Prediction of Infected Population of Coronavirus in
  Hubei Province</title>
    <summary>  After the sudden outbreak of Coronavirus in Wuhan, continuous and rich data
of the epidemic has been made public as the vital fact for decision support in
control measures and aggressive implementation of containment strategies and
plans. With the further growth and spreading of the virus, future resource
allocation and planning under updated strategies and measures rely on careful
study of the epidemic data and characteristics for accurate prediction and
estimation. By using the SIR model and reported data, key parameters are
obtained from least sum of squared errors for an accurate prediction of
epidemic trend in the last four weeks.

    <title>Planning of School Teaching during COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  More than one billion students are out of school because of Covid-19, forced
to a remote learning that has several drawbacks and has been hurriedly
arranged; in addition, most countries are currently uncertain on how to plan
school activities for the 2020-2021 school year; all of this makes learning and
education some of the biggest world issues of the current pandemic.
Unfortunately, due to the length of the incubation period of Covid-19, full
opening of schools seems to be impractical till a vaccine is available. In
order to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we study a
mathematical model of the diffusion of the epidemic due to school opening, and
evaluate plans aimed at containing the extra Covid-19 cases due to school
activities while ensuring an adequate number of in-class learning periods. We
consider a SEAIR model with an external source of infection and a suitable loss
function; after a realistic parameter selection, we numerically determine
optimal school opening strategies by simulated annealing. It turns out that
blended models, with almost periodic alternations of in-class and remote
teaching days or weeks, are generally optimal. Besides containing Covid-19
diffusion, these solutions could be pedagogically acceptable, and could also
become a driving model for the society at large. In a prototypical example, the
optimal strategy results in the school opening 90 days out of 200 with the
number of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasing
by about 66%, instead of the about 250% increase that would have been a
consequence of full opening.

    <title>Word frequency and sentiment analysis of twitter messages during
  Coronavirus pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The Coronavirus pandemic has taken the world by storm as also the social
media. As the awareness about the ailment increased, so did messages, videos
and posts acknowledging its presence. The social networking site, Twitter,
demonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus
showing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. This paper
presents a statistical analysis of the twitter messages related to this disease
posted since January 2020. Two types of empirical studies have been performed.
The first is on word frequency and the second on sentiments of the individual
tweet messages. Inspection of the word frequency is useful in characterizing
the patterns or trends in the words used on the site. This would also reflect
on the psychology of the twitter users at this critical juncture. Unigram,
bigram and trigram frequencies have been modeled by power law distribution. The
results have been validated by Sum of Square Error (SSE), R2 and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE). High values of R2 and low values of SSE and RMSE lay the
grounds for the goodness of fit of this model. Sentiment analysis has been
conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this
time. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. The
results showed that the majority of the tweets had a positive polarity and only
about 15% were negative.

    <title>E-Quarantine: A Smart Health System for Monitoring Coronavirus Patients
  for Remotely Quarantine</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus becomes officially a global pandemic due to the speed spreading
off in various countries. An increasing number of infected with this disease
causes the Inability problem to fully care in hospitals and afflict many
doctors and nurses inside the hospitals. This paper proposes a smart health
system that monitors the patients holding the Coronavirus remotely. Due to
protect the lives of the health services members (like physicians and nurses)
from infection. This smart system observes the people with this disease based
on putting many sensors to record many features of their patients in every
second. These parameters include measuring the patient's temperature,
respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, and time. The proposed system
saves lives and improves making decisions in dangerous cases. It proposes using
artificial intelligence and Internet-of-things to make remotely quarantine and
develop decisions in various situations. It provides monitoring patients
remotely and guarantees giving patients medicines and getting complete health
care without anyone getting sick with this disease. It targets two people's
slides the most serious medical conditions and infection and the lowest serious
medical conditions in their houses. Observing in hospitals for the most serious
medical cases that cause infection in thousands of healthcare members so there
is a big need to uses it. Other less serious patients slide, this system
enables physicians to monitor patients and get the healthcare from patient's
houses to save places for the critical cases in hospitals.

    <title>COVID-19 transmission risk factors</title>
    <summary>  We analyze risk factors correlated with the initial transmission growth rate
of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of cases follows an early exponential
expansion; we chose as a starting point in each country the first day with 30
cases and used 12 days. We looked for linear correlations of the exponents with
other variables, using 126 countries. We find a positive correlation with high
C.L. with the following variables, with respective $p$-value: low Temperature
($4\cdot10^{-7}$), high ratio of old vs.~working-age people ($3\cdot10^{-6}$),
life expectancy ($8\cdot10^{-6}$), number of international tourists
($1\cdot10^{-5}$), earlier epidemic starting date ($2\cdot10^{-5}$), high level
of contact in greeting habits ($6 \cdot 10^{-5}$), lung cancer ($6 \cdot
10^{-5}$), obesity in males ($1 \cdot 10^{-4}$), urbanization
($2\cdot10^{-4}$), cancer prevalence ($3 \cdot 10^{-4}$), alcohol consumption
($0.0019$), daily smoking prevalence ($0.0036$), UV index ($0.004$, smaller
sample, 73 countries), low Vitamin D levels ($p$-value $0.002-0.006$, smaller
sample, $\sim 50$ countries). There is highly significant correlation also with
blood type: positive correlation with RH- ($2\cdot10^{-5}$) and A+
($2\cdot10^{-3}$), negative correlation with B+ ($2\cdot10^{-4}$). We also find
positive correlation with moderate C.L. ($p$-value of $0.02\sim0.03$) with:
CO$_2$ emissions, type-1 diabetes, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis
(BCG). Several such variables are correlated with each other and so they likely
have common interpretations. We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias:
countries with low GDP-per capita, typically located in warm regions, might
have less intense testing and we discuss correlation with the above variables.

    <title>Likelihood of survival of coronavirus in a respiratory droplet deposited
  on a solid surface</title>
    <summary>  We predict and analyze the drying time of respiratory droplets from a
COVID-19 infected subject, which is a crucial time to infect another subject.
The drying of the droplet is predicted by diffusion-limited evaporation model
for a sessile droplet placed on a partially-wetted surface with a pinned
contact line. The variation of droplet volume, contact angle, ambient
temperature, and humidity are considered. We analyze the chances of the
survival of the viruses present in the droplet, based on the lifetime of the
droplets in several conditions, and find that the chances of survival of the
virus are strongly affected by each of these parameters. The magnitude of shear
stress inside the droplet computed using the model is not large enough to
obliterate the virus. We also explore the relationship between the drying time
of a droplet and the growth rate of the spread of COVID-19 for five different
cities, and find that they are weakly correlated.

    <title>How the world's collective attention is being paid to a pandemic:
  COVID-19 related 1-gram time series for 24 languages on Twitter</title>
    <summary>  In confronting the global spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic
we must have coordinated medical, operational, and political responses. In all
efforts, data is crucial. Fundamentally, and in the possible absence of a
vaccine for 12 to 18 months, we need universal, well-documented testing for
both the presence of the disease as well as confirmed recovery through
serological tests for antibodies, and we need to track major socioeconomic
indices. But we also need auxiliary data of all kinds, including data related
to how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic through news and
stories. To in part help on the social media side, we curate a set of 1000
day-scale time series of 1-grams across 24 languages on Twitter that are most
`important' for March 2020 with respect to March 2019. We determine importance
through our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make
some basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison
to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe
across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for `virus' in
January followed by a decline through February and a recent surge through
March. The world's collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out
from China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis
while relevant. Our main intent is for other researchers to use these time
series to enhance whatever analyses that may be of use during the pandemic as
well as for retrospective investigations.

    <title>Knowledge synthesis from 100 million biomedical documents augments the
  deep expression profiling of coronavirus receptors</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all available biomedical
knowledge to decode its mechanisms of pathogenicity and transmission. Despite
the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding
unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the
exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation
with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform
for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations
extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with
Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this
platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of
COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor
ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes and olfactory epithelial cells are
likely under-appreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, correlating with
reported loss of sense of taste and smell as early indicators of COVID-19
infection, including in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Airway club cells,
ciliated cells and type II pneumocytes in the lung, and enterocytes of the gut
also express ACE2. This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform
can leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly
available data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights
and hypotheses.

    <title>Tracking COVID-19 using online search</title>
    <summary>  Research outcomes over the years have showcased the capacity of online search
behaviour to model various properties of infectious diseases. In this work we
use online search query frequency time series to gain insights about the
prevalence of COVID-19 in multiple countries. We first develop unsupervised
modelling techniques based on identified symptom categories by United Kingdom's
National Health Service. We then propose ways for minimising an expected bias
in these signals partially generated by the early and continuous exposure to
news media. We also look into transfer learning techniques for mapping
supervised models from countries where the disease spread has progressed to
countries that are in earlier phases of the epidemic curve. Furthermore, we
analyse the time series of online search queries in relation to confirmed
COVID-19 cases data jointly across multiple countries, uncovering interesting
patterns. Finally, we show results from short-term forecasting models based on
Gaussian Processes that combine confirmed cases and online search data time
series.

    <title>Lockdown Strategies, Mobility Patterns and COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We develop a multiple-events model and exploit within and between country
variation in the timing, type and level of intensity of various public policies
to study their dynamic effects on the daily incidence of COVID-19 and on
population mobility patterns across 135 countries. We remove concurrent policy
bias by taking into account the contemporaneous presence of multiple
interventions. The main result of the paper is that cancelling public events
and imposing restrictions on private gatherings followed by school closures
have quantitatively the most pronounced effects on reducing the daily incidence
of COVID-19. They are followed by workplace as well as stay-at-home
requirements, whose statistical significance and levels of effect are not as
pronounced. Instead, we find no effects for international travel controls,
public transport closures and restrictions on movements across cities and
regions. We establish that these findings are mediated by their effect on
population mobility patterns in a manner consistent with time-use and
epidemiological factors.

    <title>Role of a Habitat's Air Humidity in Covid-19 Mortality</title>
    <summary>  Transient local over-dry environment might be a contributor and an
explanation for the observed asynchronous local rises in Covid-19 mortality. We
propose that a habitat's air humidity negatively correlate with Covid-19
morbidity and mortality, and support this hypothesis on the example of publicly
available data from German federal states.

    <title>Long-range correlations in Covid-19 growth</title>
    <summary>  The fractal statistics were applied to the daily new cases of COVID-19 in the
USA. The Hurst parameter, which indicates the long-range correlations in the
growth, was calculated using a simple R/S method based on the fluctuations of
the daily growth for several US states. The values of Hurst parameters for
different states were analyzed using two controlling parameters, stay-at-home
order, and the population density.

    <title>The Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is Highly Contagious and More
  Infectious Than Initially Estimated</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that
has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number,
R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this
quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key
epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these
estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with
mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals
during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be
between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of
symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control
measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

    <title>From plague to coronavirus: On the value of ship traffic data for
  epidemic modeling</title>
    <summary>  In addition to moving people and goods, ships can spread disease. Ship
traffic may complement air traffic as a source of import risk, and cruise ships
- with large passenger volumes and multiple stops - are potential hotspots, in
particular for diseases with long incubation periods. Vessel trajectory data
from ship Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) is available online and it is
possible to extract and analyze this data. We illustrate this in the case of
the current coronavirus epidemic, in which hundreds of infected individuals
have traveled in ships captured in the AIS dataset. This real time and
historical data should be included in epidemiological models of disease to
inform the corresponding operational response.

    <title>Coronavirus and sports leagues: how to obtain a fair ranking if the
  season cannot resume?</title>
    <summary>  Many sports leagues are played in a tightly scheduled round-robin format,
leaving a limited time window to postpone matches. If the season cannot resume
due to an external shock such as the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, the ranking
of the teams becomes non-trivial because it is necessary to account for
schedule imbalances. We identify a set of desired axioms for ranking in such
incomplete tournaments and verify that the generalized row sum, a parametric
family of scoring rules, satisfies all of them. In particular, the
well-established least squares method maximizes the role of the opponents. Our
approach is applied for the five major premier European soccer competitions,
where the rankings are found to be robust concerning the weight of adjustment
for the opponents. Since disregarding the majority of the matches without
promotion, relegation, and qualification for international cups would be unfair
and unjustified, some simpler alternative policies are also discussed.

    <title>BIMCV COVID-19+: a large annotated dataset of RX and CT images from
  COVID-19 patients</title>
    <summary>  This paper describes BIMCV COVID-19+, a large dataset from the Valencian
Region Medical ImageBank (BIMCV) containing chest X-ray images CXR (CR, DX) and
computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19+ patients along with their
radiological findings and locations, pathologies, radiological reports (in
Spanish), DICOM metadata, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Immunoglobulin G
(IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) diagnostic antibody tests. The findings have
been mapped onto standard Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) terminology
and cover a wide spectrum of thoracic entities, unlike the considerably more
reduced number of entities annotated in previous datasets. Images are stored in
high resolution and entities are localized with anatomical labels and stored in
a Medical Imaging Data Structure (MIDS) format. In addition, 10 images were
annotated by a team of radiologists to include semantic segmentation of
radiological findings. This first iteration of the database includes 1,380 CX,
885 DX and 163 CT studies from 1,311 COVID-19+ patients. This is, to the best
of our knowledge, the largest COVID-19+ dataset of images available in an open
format. The dataset can be downloaded from
http://bimcv.cipf.es/bimcv-projects/bimcv-covid19.

    <title>COVID-19-CT-CXR: a freely accessible and weakly labeled chest X-ray and
  CT image collection on COVID-19 from biomedical literature</title>
    <summary>  The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there
exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans,
few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy.
At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the
biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of
COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from
COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset.
We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in
the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a
deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify
them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as
of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of
COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that
COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute
to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to
distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of
diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from
non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4)
From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms
and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the
disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is
complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical
image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are
publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.

    <title>Digit analysis for Covid-19 reported data</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus which appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan has spread out
worldwide and caused the death of more than 280,000 people (as of May, 11
2020). Since February 2020, doubts were raised about the numbers of confirmed
cases and deaths reported by the Chinese government. In this paper, we examine
data available from China at the city and provincial levels and we compare them
with Canadian provincial data, US state data and French regional data. We
consider cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths and examine
these numbers through the lens of their first two digits and in particular we
measure departures of these first two digits to the Newcomb-Benford
distribution, often used to detect frauds. Our finding is that there is no
evidence that cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths for
all these countries have different first or second digit distributions. We also
show that the Newcomb-Benford distribution cannot be rejected for these data.

    <title>Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Analysis of subgenomic mRNA transcription,
  3CLpro and PL2pro protease cleavage sites and protein synthesis</title>
    <summary>  Coronaviruses have recently caused world-wide severe outbreaks: SARS (Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2002 and MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome)
in 2012. At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak appeared in Wuhan
(China) seafood market as first focus of infection, becoming a pandemics in
2020, spreading mainly into Europe and Asia. Although the virus family is
well-known, this specific virus presents considerable differences, as higher
transmission rates, being a challenge for diagnostic methods, treatments and
vaccines. Coronavirus(C++).pro is a C++ application which simulates Coronavirus
replication cycle. This software has identified virus type in short times and
provided FASTA files of virus proteins, a list of mRNA sequences and secondary
structures. Furthermore, the software has identified a list of structural,
non-structural and accessory proteins in 2019-nCoV virus genome more similar to
SARS than to MERS, as several fusion proteins characteristics of this virus
type. These results are useful as a first step in order to develop diagnostic
methods, new vaccines or antiviral drugs, which could avoid virus replication
in any stage: fusion inhibitors, RdRp inhibitors and PL2pro/3CLpro protease
inhibitors.

    <summary>  COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented social distancing policies being
enforced worldwide. As governments urgently seek to reopen society, there is a
demand for technologies that may alleviate the requirement for social
distancing whilst also protecting healthcare services and maintaining human and
civil rights. In this work we explore the controversial technique of so-called
immunity passports and present SecureABC: a decentralised, privacy-preserving
system for issuing and verifying antibody certificates. We consider the
implications of immunity passport systems, develop a set of general principles
and security requirements for their deployment and show that these may be
satisfied in practice.

    <title>On Accelerated Testing for COVID-19 Using Group Testing</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has resulted in a global health crisis that may become even more
acute over the upcoming months. One of the main reasons behind the current
rapid growth of COVID-19 in the U.S. population is the limited availability of
testing kits and the relatively-high cost of screening tests. In this draft, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of group testing (pooling) ideas to accelerate
testing for COVID-19. This draft is semi-tutorial in nature and is written for
a broad audience with interest in mathematical formulations relevant to
COVID-19 testing. Therefore, ideas are presented through illustrative examples
rather than through purely theoretical formulations. The focus is also on pools
of size less than 64 such as what is practical with current RT-PCR technology.

    <title>Computer Vision For COVID-19 Control: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an urgent need to contribute to the fight
against an immense threat to the human population. Computer Vision, as a
subfield of Artificial Intelligence, has enjoyed recent success in solving
various complex problems in health care and has the potential to contribute to
the fight of controlling COVID-19. In response to this call, computer vision
researchers are putting their knowledge base at work to devise effective ways
to counter COVID-19 challenge and serve the global community. New contributions
are being shared with every passing day. It motivated us to review the recent
work, collect information about available research resources and an indication
of future research directions. We want to make it available to computer vision
researchers to save precious time. This survey paper is intended to provide a
preliminary review of the available literature on the computer vision efforts
against COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Why do People Share Misinformation during the COVID-19 Pandemic?</title>
    <summary>  The World Health Organization have emphasised that misinformation - spreading
rapidly through social media - poses a serious threat to the COVID-19 response.
Drawing from theories of health perception and cognitive load, we develop and
test a research model hypothesizing why people share unverified COVID-19
information through social media. Our findings suggest a person's trust in
online information and perceived information overload are strong predictors of
unverified information sharing. Furthermore, these factors, along with a
person's perceived COVID-19 severity and vulnerability influence cyberchondria.
Females were significantly more likely to suffer from cyberchondria, however,
males were more likely to share news without fact checking their source. Our
findings suggest that to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 misinformation and
cyberchondria, measures should be taken to enhance a healthy skepticism of
health news while simultaneously guarding against information overload.

    <title>On the airborne aspect of COVID-19 coronovirus</title>
    <summary>  It is a widely accepted view that COVID 19 is either transmitted via surface
contamination or via close contact of an un-infected person with an infected
person. Surface contamination usually happens when infected water droplets from
exhalation/sneeze/cough of COVID sick person settle on nearby surfaces. To curb
this, social distancing and good hand hygiene advise is advocated by World
health Organization (WHO). We argue that COVID 19 coronovirus can also be
airborne in a puff cloud loaded with infected droplets generated by COVID sick
person. An elementary calculation shows that a $5~\mu m$ respiratory infected
droplet can remain suspended for about 9.0 minutes and a $2~\mu m$ droplet can
remain suspended for about an hour! And social distancing advise of 3 feet by
WHO and 6 feet by CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) may not be
sufficient in some circumstances as discussed in the text.

    <title>Dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in India</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for improved
control and social distancing strategies. To that effect, we have employed the
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, refined by contact tracing and
hospitalization data from Indian provinces Kerala, Delhi, Maharashtra, and West
Bengal, as well as from overall India. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
to identify the most crucial input parameters, and we have calibrated the model
to describe the data as best as possible. Short-term predictions reveal an
increasing and worrying trend of COVID-19 cases for all four provinces and
India as a whole, while long-term predictions also reveal the possibility of
oscillatory dynamics. Our research thus leaves the option open that COVID-19
might become a seasonal occurrence. We also simulate and discuss the impact of
media on the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Preliminary prediction of the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan
  novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV</title>
    <summary>  Objectives.--To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Methods.--Based on the
susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the
assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before January 25,
2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the
basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed
cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of
infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological
determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results The
basic reproduction number falls between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time
reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China,
and falls between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected
cases from colleagues. Conclusions.--The early transmission ability of
2019-nCoV is closed to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable
disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control
measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions. Notes Added.--Using
a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the
estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0].

    <title>Covid-19 Tweeting in English: Gender Differences</title>
    <summary>  At the start of 2020, COVID-19 became the most urgent threat to global public
health. Uniquely in recent times, governments have imposed partly voluntary,
partly compulsory restrictions on the population to slow the spread of the
virus. In this context, public attitudes and behaviors are vitally important
for reducing the death rate. Analyzing tweets about the disease may therefore
give insights into public reactions that may help guide public information
campaigns. This article analyses 3,038,026 English tweets about COVID-19 from
March 10 to 23, 2020. It focuses on one relevant aspect of public reaction:
gender differences. The results show that females are more likely to tweet
about the virus in the context of family, social distancing and healthcare
whereas males are more likely to tweet about sports cancellations, the global
spread of the virus and political reactions. Thus, women seem to be taking a
disproportionate share of the responsibility for directly keeping the
population safe. The detailed results may be useful to inform public
information announcements and to help understand the spread of the virus. For
example, failure to impose a sporting bans whilst encouraging social distancing
may send mixed messages to males.

    <title>Digital Herd Immunity and COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  A population can be immune to epidemics even if not all of its individual
members are immune to the disease, just as long as sufficiently many are immune
- this is the traditional notion of herd immunity. In the smartphone era a
population can be immune to epidemics even if not a single one of its members
is immune to the disease - a notion we propose to call "digital herd immunity",
which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity
arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can
lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus
the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are
favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune
phase. As usage decreases there is a novel "contact tracing" phase transition
to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for
COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the
proportion of non-symptomatic transmission. We believe this is a promising
strategy for dealing with COVID-19 in many countries such as India, whose
challenges of scale motivated us to undertake this study.

    <title>Short-Term Covid-19 Forecast for Latecomers</title>
    <summary>  The number of Covid-19 cases is increasing dramatically worldwide. Therefore,
the availability of reliable forecasts for the number of cases in the coming
days is of fundamental importance. We propose a simple statistical method for
short-term real-time forecasting of the number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities
in countries that are latecomers -- i.e., countries where cases of the disease
started to appear some time after others. In particular, we propose a penalized
(LASSO) regression with an error correction mechanism to construct a model of a
latecomer in terms of the other countries that were at a similar stage of the
pandemic some days before. By tracking the number of cases and deaths in those
countries, we forecast through an adaptive rolling-window scheme the number of
cases and deaths in the latecomer. We apply this methodology to Brazil, and
show that (so far) it has been performing very well. These forecasts aim to
foster a better short-run management of the health system capacity.

    <title>A Note on Early Epidemiological Analysis of Coronavirus Disease 2019
  Outbreak using Crowdsourced Data</title>
    <summary>  Crowdsourcing data can prove of paramount importance in monitoring and
controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The recent paper by Sun, Chen
and Viboud (2020) is important because it contributes to the understanding of
the epidemiology and of the spreading of Covid-19 in a period when most of the
epidemic characteristics are still unknown. However, the use of crowdsourcing
data raises a number of problems from the statistical point of view which run
the risk of invalidating the results and of biasing estimation and hypothesis
testing. While the work by Sun, Chen and Viboud (2020) has to be commended,
given the importance of the topic for worldwide health security, in this paper
we deem important to remark the presence of the possible sources of statistical
biases and to point out possible solutions to them

    <title>Assessing the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on unhappiness,
  loneliness, and boredom using Google Trends</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has led many governments to implement lockdowns. While
lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, it is possible that
substantial damage to population well-being will result. This study relies on
Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and
America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using
different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a
substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US.
We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and
sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell.
Our results suggest that people's mental health may have been severely affected
by the lockdown.

    <title>On the dynamics of the Coronavirus epidemic and the unreported cases:
  the Chilean case</title>
    <summary>  We analyze the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic taking into account the role
of the unreported cases. After a first section in which we deal with a
framework of very slow test capacity, we turn to the model recently
introduced/implemented by Liu, Magal, Seydi and Webb. First, we prove some
basic structural results for the corresponding ODE, as for instance the
convergence of S(t) to a positive limit. These are similar to those of the
classical SIR model, although the maxima of the corresponding curves are not
necessarily unique. Finally, we implement the model -- but with a variable
transmission rate -- in the Chilean context. A key parameter adjustment
(namely, the fraction of unreported cases) is done via an argument using
mortality rates. We conclude with several conclusions and lines of future
research.

    <title>Artificial Intelligence Forecasting of Covid-19 in China</title>
    <summary>  BACKGROUND An alternative to epidemiological models for transmission dynamics
of Covid-19 in China, we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired
methods for real-time forecasting of Covid-19 to estimate the size, lengths and
ending time of Covid-19 across China. METHODS We developed a modified stacked
auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We
applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by
WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms
to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across
China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,
the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step
forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted
that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the
forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,
2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The
accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was
high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of
April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can
accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the
provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for
helping public health planning and policymaking.

    <title>Pro-Russian Biases in Anti-Chinese Tweets about the Novel Coronavirus</title>
    <summary>  The recent COVID-19 pandemic, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, has
been linked to increased anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. Recently,
Broniatowski et al. found that foreign powers, and especially Russia, were
implicated in information operations using public health crises to promote
discord -- including racial conflict -- in American society (Broniatowski,
2018). This brief considers the problem of automatically detecting changes in
overall attitudes, that may be associated with emerging information operations,
via artificial intelligence. Accurate analysis of these emerging topics usually
requires laborious, manual analysis by experts to annotate millions of tweets
to identify biases in new topics. We introduce extensions of the Word Embedding
Association Test from Caliskan et. al to a new domain (Caliskan, 2017). This
practical and unsupervised method is applied to quantify biases being promoted
in information operations. Analyzing historical information operations from
Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, we quantify
biased attitudes for presidential candidates, and sentiment toward Muslim
groups. We next apply this method to a corpus of tweets containing anti-Chinese
hashtags. We find that roughly 1% of tweets in our corpus reference
Russian-funded news sources and use anti-Chinese hashtags and, beyond the
expected anti-Chinese attitudes, we find that this corpus as a whole contains
pro-Russian attitudes, which are not present in a control Twitter corpus
containing general tweets. Additionally, 4% of the users in this corpus were
suspended within a week. These findings may indicate the presence of abusive
account activity associated with rapid changes in attitudes around the COVID-19
public health crisis, suggesting potential information operations.

    <title>COVID_MTNet: COVID-19 Detection with Multi-Task Deep Learning Approaches</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is currently one the most life-threatening problems around the
world. The fast and accurate detection of the COVID-19 infection is essential
to identify, take better decisions and ensure treatment for the patients which
will help save their lives. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient way
to identify COVID-19 patients with multi-task deep learning (DL) methods. Both
X-ray and CT scan images are considered to evaluate the proposed technique. We
employ our Inception Residual Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network with
Transfer Learning (TL) approach for COVID-19 detection and our NABLA-N network
model for segmenting the regions infected by COVID-19. The detection model
shows around 84.67% testing accuracy from X-ray images and 98.78% accuracy in
CT-images. A novel quantitative analysis strategy is also proposed in this
paper to determine the percentage of infected regions in X-ray and CT images.
The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate promising results for
COVID-19 detection and infected region localization.

    <title>Atmospheric CO$_2$ and total electricity production before and during
  the nation-wide restriction of activities as a consequence of the COVID-19
  pandemic</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we analysed real-time measurements of atmospheric CO$_2$ with
total electricity production and nation-wide restrictions phases due to the
novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, and its effects on atmospheric CO$_2$
concentrations. A decline of 3.7% in the global energy demand at about 150
million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in the first quarter (Q1), of 2020 was
recorded, as compared to the same first quarter (Q1), of 2019, due to the
cutback on global economic activities. Our results showed that: 1) electricity
production for the same period in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, shrunk at an
offset of about 9.20%, which resulted in the modest reduction of about
(-1.79%), in the atmospheric CO$_2$, to that of 2017-2018 CO$_2$ level; 2) a
non-seasonal abrupt; but brief, atmospheric CO$_2$ decrease by about 0.85% in
mid-February 2020, could be due to the Phase 1 movement restrictions in China.
The results showed that, the reduction in electricity production is significant
to the short-term variability of atmospheric CO$_2$. It also highlights the
significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO$_2$, which suggests
that, without the national restriction of activities, CO$_2$ concentration are
set to exceed 2019 by 1.79%, but it quickly decreased due to the lockdown, and
sustained the reduction for two consecutive months. The results underscore the
atmospheric CO$_2$ reductions on the monthly time scale that can be achieved,
if electricity production from combustible sources were slashed, which could be
useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in electricity production
from combustible sources, and the impact of these reduction to the atmospheric
CO$_2$.

    <title>Dynamic causal modelling of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  This technical report describes a dynamic causal model of the spread of
coronavirus through a population. The model is based upon ensemble or
population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over
time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends
predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional
dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social
distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict
what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages
state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison
procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal
ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological
populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the
model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of
this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some
interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear
effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.

    <title>Market structure dynamics during COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <summary>  In this note, we discuss the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak from the
perspective of the market-structure. We observe that the US market-structure
has dramatically changed during the past four weeks and that the level of
change has followed the number of infected cases reported in the USA.
Presently, market-structure resembles most closely the structure during the
middle of the 2008 crisis but there are signs that it may be starting to evolve
into a new structure altogether. This is the first article of a series where we
will be analyzing and discussing market-structure as it evolves to a state of
further instability or, more optimistically, stabilization and recovery.

    <title>COVID-19 amplifies gender disparities in research</title>
    <summary>  Early evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are
disproportionately affected by the \mbox{COVID-19} pandemic, with negative
consequences to their productivity. Here, we test this hypothesis by analyzing
the proportion of male and female researchers that publish scientific papers
during the pandemic. We use data from biomedical preprint servers and
Springer-Nature journals to show that the fraction of women publishing during
the pandemic drops significantly across disciplines and research topics, after
controlling for temporal trends. The impact is particularly pronounced for
biomedical papers related to COVID-19 research. Further, by geocoding author's
affiliations, we show that gender disparities are exacerbated in poorer
countries, even though these countries had less of a gender gap in research
prior to the pandemic. Our results illustrate how exceptional events like a
global pandemic can further amplify gender inequalities in research. Our work
could inform fairer scientific evaluation practices, especially for
early-career female researchers who may be disproportionately affected by the
pandemic.

    <title>Urban Scaling of COVID-19 epidemics</title>
    <summary>  Susceptible-Invective-Recovered (SIR) mathematical models are in high demand
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are used in their standard formulation, or
through the many variants, trying to fit and hopefully predict the number of
new cases for the next days or weeks, in any place, city, or country. Such is
key knowledge for the authorities to prepare for the health systems demand or
to apply restrictions to slow down the infectives curve. Even when the model
can be easily solved ---by the use of specialized software or by programming
the numerical solution of the differential equations that represent the
model---, the prediction is a non-easy task, because the behavioral change of
people is reflected in a continuous change of the parameters. A relevant
question is what we can use of one city to another; if what happened in Madrid
could have been applied to New York and then, if what we have learned from this
city would be of use for S\~ao Paulo. With this idea in mind, we present an
analysis of a spreading-rate related measure of COVID-19 as a function of
population density and population size for all US counties, as long as for
Brazilian cities and German cities. Contrary to what is the common hypothesis
in epidemics modeling, we observe a higher {\em per-capita} contact rate for
higher city's population density and population size. Also, we find that the
population size has a more explanatory effect than the population density. A
contact rate scaling theory is proposed to explain the results.

    <title>COVID-19Base: A knowledgebase to explore biomedical entities related to
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We are presenting COVID-19Base, a knowledgebase highlighting the biomedical
entities related to COVID-19 disease based on literature mining. To develop
COVID-19Base, we mine the information from publicly available scientific
literature and related public resources. We considered seven topic-specific
dictionaries, including human genes, human miRNAs, human lncRNAs, diseases,
Protein Databank, drugs, and drug side effects, are integrated to mine all
scientific evidence related to COVID-19. We have employed an automated
literature mining and labeling system through a novel approach to measure the
effectiveness of drugs against diseases based on natural language processing,
sentiment analysis, and deep learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first knowledgebase dedicated to COVID-19, which integrates such large
variety of related biomedical entities through literature mining. Proper
investigation of the mined biomedical entities along with the identified
interactions among those, reported in COVID-19Base, would help the research
community to discover possible ways for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.

    <title>Forecasting and evaluating intervention of Covid-19 in the World</title>
    <summary>  When the Covid-19 pandemic enters dangerous new phase, whether and when to
take aggressive public health interventions to slow down the spread of
COVID-19. To develop the artificial intelligence (AI) inspired methods for
real-time forecasting and evaluating intervention strategies to curb the spread
of Covid-19 in the World. A modified auto-encoder for modeling the transmission
dynamics of the epidemics is developed and applied to the surveillance data of
cumulative and new Covid-19 cases and deaths from WHO, as of March 16, 2020.
The average errors of 5-step forecasting were 2.5%. The total peak number of
cumulative cases and new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in
the world with later intervention (comprehensive public health intervention is
implemented 4 weeks later) could reach 75,249,909, 10,086,085, and 255,392,154,
respectively. The case ending time was January 10, 2021. However, the total
peak number of cumulative cases and new cases and the maximum number of
cumulative cases in the world with one week later intervention were reduced to
951,799, 108,853 and 1,530,276, respectively. Duration time of the Covid-19
spread would be reduced from 356 days to 232 days. The case ending time was
September 8, 2020. We observed that delaying intervention for one month caused
the maximum number of cumulative cases to increase 166.89 times, and the number
of deaths increase from 53,560 to 8,938,725. We will face disastrous
consequences if immediate action to intervene is not taken.

    <title>A comparison of group testing architectures for COVID-19 testing</title>
    <summary>  An important component of every country's COVID-19 response is fast and
efficient testing -- to identify and isolate cases, as well as for early
detection of local hotspots. For many countries, producing a sufficient number
of tests has been a serious limiting factor in their efforts to control
COVID-19 infections. Group testing is a well-established mathematical tool,
which can provide a serious and rapid improvement to this situation. In this
note, we compare several well-established group testing schemes in the context
of qPCR testing for COVID-19. We include example calculations, where we
indicate which testing architectures yield the greatest efficiency gains in
various settings. We find that for identification of individuals with COVID-19,
array testing is usually the best choice, while for estimation of COVID-19
prevalence rates in the total population, Gibbs-Gower testing usually provides
the most accurate estimates given a fixed and relatively small number of tests.
This note is intended as a helpful handbook for labs implementing group testing
methods.

    <title>How Does COVID-19 impact Students with Disabilities/Health Concerns?</title>
    <summary>  The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in
worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and
increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with
disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online
learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by
additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our
knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students
with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey
of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early
April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and
mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health
concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers
without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns
also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities
compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that
students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence
in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming
increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but
also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more
accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a
supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.

    <title>Machine Learning Automatically Detects COVID-19 using Chest CTs in a
  Large Multicenter Cohort</title>
    <summary>  Purpose: To investigate if AI-based classifiers can distinguish COVID-19 from
other pulmonary diseases and normal groups, using chest CT images. To study the
interpretability of discriminative features for COVID19 detection. Materials
and Methods: Our database consists of 2096 CT exams that include CTs from 1150
COVID-19 patients. Training was performed on 1000 COVID-19, 131 ILD, 113 other
pneumonias, 559 normal CTs, and testing on 100 COVID-19, 30 ILD, 30 other
pneumonias, and 34 normal CTs. A metric-based approach for classification of
COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and random
forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 based on 3D
features extracted directly from CT intensities and from the probability
distribution of airspace opacities. Results: Most discriminative features of
COVID-19 are percentage of airspace opacity, ground glass opacities,
consolidations, and peripheral and basal opacities, which coincide with the
typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering compares the distribution of these features across
COVID-19 and control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC,
sensitivity, and specificity of respectively 0.85, 0.81, and 0.77. The DL-based
classifier achieved AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of respectively 0.90,
0.86, and 0.81. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with
manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as COVID-19 cases in early
stages. Conclusion: A new method discriminates COVID-19 from other types of
pneumonia, ILD, and normal, using quantitative patterns from chest CT. Our
models balance interpretability of results and classification performance, and
therefore may be useful to expedite and improve diagnosis of COVID-19.

    <title>Temperature dependence of COVID-19 transmission</title>
    <summary>  The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost
exponential growth, with the number of cases quite well fit in time by
$N(t)\propto e^{\alpha t}$, in many countries. We analyze the rate $\alpha$ for
each country, starting from a threshold of 30 total cases and using the next 12
days, capturing thus the early growth homogeneously. We look for a link between
$\alpha$ and the average temperature $T$ of each country, in the month of the
epidemic growth. We analyze a {\it base} set of 42 countries, which developed
the epidemic earlier, an {\it intermediate} set of 88 countries and an {\it
extended} set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently.
Applying a linear fit $\alpha(T)$, we find increasing evidence for a decreasing
$\alpha$ as a function of $T$, at $99.66\%$C.L., $99.86\%$C.L. and $99.99995
\%$ C.L. ($p$-value $5 \cdot 10^{-7}$, or 5$\sigma$ detection) in the {\it
base}, {\it intermediate} and {\it extended} dataset, respectively. The
doubling time is expected to increase by $40\%\sim 50\%$, going from $5^\circ$
C to $25^\circ$ C. In the {\it base} set, going beyond a linear model, a peak
at $(7.7\pm 3.6)^\circ C$ seems to be present, but its evidence disappears for
the larger datasets. We also analyzed a possible bias: poor countries, often
located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding
countries below a given GDP per capita, we find that our conclusions are only
slightly affected and only for the {\it extended} dataset. The significance
remains high, with a $p$-value of $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ or less. Our findings give
hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should
significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown
policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong
lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the cold season.

    <title>Connecting the Dots of COVID-19 Transmissions in India</title>
    <summary>  Witnessing its first case in late January 2020 India has seen a sharp rise in
the number of positive cases of COVID-19. 34 States/UT (s) of the country have
been found to be affected by the pandemic to date. We in this work, study the
progress of COVID-19 pandemic in India. We aim to create transmission network
visualization (s) of COVID-19 in India and perform analysis upon them. Using
the transmission networks obtained we attempt to find the possible Super
Spreader Individual (s) and Super Spreader Events (SSE) responsible for the
outbreak in their respective regions. We discuss the potentials of network
analysis in mitigating the further spread of the disease. This is one of the
initial studies of the outbreak in India and the first attempt to study the
pandemic in the country from a transmission network perspective.

    <title>Rapidly Bootstrapping a Question Answering Dataset for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We present CovidQA, the beginnings of a question answering dataset
specifically designed for COVID-19, built by hand from knowledge gathered from
Kaggle's COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. To our knowledge, this is
the first publicly available resource of its type, and intended as a stopgap
measure for guiding research until more substantial evaluation resources become
available. While this dataset, comprising 124 question-article pairs as of the
present version 0.1 release, does not have sufficient examples for supervised
machine learning, we believe that it can be helpful for evaluating the
zero-shot or transfer capabilities of existing models on topics specifically
related to COVID-19. This paper describes our methodology for constructing the
dataset and presents the effectiveness of a number of baselines, including
term-based techniques and various transformer-based models. The dataset is
available at http://covidqa.ai/

    <title>Unequal Impact and Spatial Aggregation Distort COVID-19 Growth Rates</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a global public health crisis. To make
decisions about mitigation strategies and to understand the disease dynamics,
policy makers and epidemiologists must know how the disease is spreading in
their communities. We analyze confirmed infections and deaths over multiple
geographic scales to show that COVID-19's impact is highly unequal: many
subregions have nearly zero infections, and others are hot spots. We attribute
the effect to a Reed-Hughes-like mechanism in which disease arrives at
different times and grows exponentially. Hot spots, however, appear to grow
faster than neighboring subregions and dominate spatially aggregated
statistics, thereby amplifying growth rates. The staggered spread of COVID-19
can also make aggregated growth rates appear higher even when subregions grow
at the same rate. Public policy, economic analysis and epidemic modeling need
to account for potential distortions introduced by spatial aggregation.

    <title>Branching stochastic processes as models of Covid-19 epidemic
  development</title>
    <summary>  The aim of the paper is to describe two models of Covid-19 infection
dynamics. For this purpose a special class of branching processes with two
types of individuals is considered. These models are intended to use only the
observed daily statistics to estimate the main parameter of the infection and
to give a prediction of the mean value of the non-observed population of the
infected individuals. Similar problems are considered also in the case when the
processes admit an immigration component. This is a serious advantage in
comparison with other more complicated models where the officially reported
data are not sufficient for estimation of the model parameters. In this way the
specific development of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered also for all
countries as it is given in the specially created site
http://ir-statistics.net/covid-19 where the obtained results are updated daily.

    <title>An Exploratory Study of COVID-19 Misinformation on Twitter</title>
    <summary>  Although a lot of correct and useful information is shared through channels
such as Twitter, it has also become a home ground for misinformation on
COVID-19. To tackle this still ongoing infodemic, scientific oversight as well
as a better understanding by practitioners in crisis management is needed. We
have conducted an exploratory study into the propagation, authors and content
of misinformation on Twitter around the topic of COVID-19 in order to gain
early insights into the COVID-19 infodemic. Our results enable us to not only
give first indications but also to suggest gaps in the current scientific
coverage of the topic. Moreover, we propose actions for authorities to counter
misinformation and hints for social media users on how to help stop the spread
of misinformation.

    <title>Endpoints for randomized controlled clinical trials for COVID-19
  treatments</title>
    <summary>  Introduction: Endpoint choice for randomized controlled trials of treatments
for COVID-19 is complex. A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials
must start rapidly. COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that
improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks and can end in
death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence
about clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating
mortality are large and may be impractical. Furthermore, patient states in
between "cure" and "death" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity
scores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary
measure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly in
relating to the uncertainty about the time-course of COVID-19. Outcomes
measured at fixed time-points may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An
endpoint such as time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem.
However, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the
ordinal scale to a binary state of "recovered" vs "not recovered."
  Methods: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for
COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent
COVID-19 treatment trials.
  Results: Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time
selected for evaluation. Time-to-improvement (or recovery) analyses do not
specify a time-point. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical
power, even when compared to a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal
time.
  Discussion: Time-to-event analyses methods have advantages in the COVID-19
setting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in
advance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may
increase power for interim analyses.

    <title>A reproduction rate which perfectly fits Covid-19</title>
    <summary>  We present a simple technique to compare the development of the Covid-19
epidemic in different regions, based only on the time series of confirmed
cases. Weekly new infections, taken for every day, are interpreted as infection
potential of Covid-19. We derive a robust time-varying reproduction rate for
the infection potential, including asymptomatic cases, which does not depend on
death rate or testing intensity. It requires few assumptions and shows a more
plausible time course than official reproduction rates in several countries.

    <title>Genomics-guided molecular maps of coronavirus targets in human cells: a
  path toward the repurposing of existing drugs to mitigate the pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Human genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, ACE2 and FURIN,
were employed as baits to build genomics-guided maps of up-stream regulatory
elements, their expression and functions in human body, including
pathophysiologically-relevant cell types. Genes acting as repressors and
activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of
gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic
mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators
(HMGA2; INSIG1) were then employed to identify existing drugs that could be
repurposed to mitigate the coronavirus infection. Present analyses identify
Vitamin D and Quercetin as promising pandemic mitigation agents. Gene
expression profiles of Vitamin D and Quercetin activities and their established
safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances suggest that they may
represent viable candidates for further assessment and considerations of their
potential as coronavirus pandemic mitigation agents. Notably, gene set
enrichment analyses and expression profiling experiments identify multiple
drugs, most notably testosterone, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin, smoking, and
many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus
infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of Testosterone versus
Estradiol impacts on SCARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular
explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during coronavirus
pandemic.

    <title>Lessons from being challenged by COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We present results of different approaches to model the evolution of the
COVID-19 epidemic in Argentina, with a special focus on the megacity conformed
by the city of Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area, including a total of 41
districts with over 13 million inhabitants. We first highlight the relevance of
interpreting the early stage of the epidemic in light of incoming infectious
travelers from abroad. Next, we critically evaluate certain proposed solutions
to contain the epidemic based on instantaneous modifications of the
reproductive number. Finally, we build increasingly complex and realistic
models, ranging from simple homogeneous models used to estimate local
reproduction numbers, to fully coupled inhomogeneous (deterministic or
stochastic) models incorporating mobility estimates from cell phone location
data. The models are capable of producing forecasts highly consistent with the
official number of cases with minimal parameter fitting and fine-tuning. We
discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed models, focusing on the
validity of different necessary first approximations, and caution future
modeling efforts to exercise great care in the interpretation of long-term
forecasts, and in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions backed by
numerical simulations.

    <title>Controlling the Hidden Growth of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has plagued the world for months. The U.S. has taken
measures to counter it. On a daily basis, newly confirmed cases have been
reported. In the early days, these numbers showed an increasing trend.
Recently, the numbers have been generally flattened out. This report tries to
estimate the hidden number of currently alive infections in the population by
using the confirmed cases. A major result indicates an existing infections
estimate at about 10-50 times the daily confirmed new cases, with the stringent
social distancing policy tipping to the upper end of this range. It clarifies
the relationship between the infection rate and the test rate to put the
epidemic under control, which says that the test rate shall keep up at the same
pace as infection rate to prevent an outbreak. This relationship is meaningful
in the wake of business re-opening in the U.S. and the world. The report also
reveals the connections of all the measures taken to the epidemic spread. A
stratified sampling method is proposed to add to the current tool kits of
epidemic control. Again, this report is a summary of some straight observations
and thoughts, not through a thorough study backed with field data. The results
appear obvious and suitable for general education to interested policymakers
and the public.

    <title>A quantitative compendium of COVID-19 epidemiology</title>
    <summary>  Accurate numbers are needed to understand and predict viral dynamics.
Curation of high-quality literature values for the infectious period duration
or household secondary attack rate, for example, is especially pressing
currently because these numbers inform decisions about how and when to lockdown
or reopen societies. We aim to provide a curated source for the key numbers
that help us understand the virus driving our current global crisis. This
compendium focuses solely on COVID-19 epidemiology. The numbers reported in
summary format are substantiated by annotated references. For each property, we
provide a concise definition, description of measurement and inference methods
and associated caveats. We hope this compendium will make essential numbers
more accessible and avoid common sources of confusion for the many newcomers to
the field such as using the incubation period to denote and quantify the latent
period or using the hospitalization duration for the infectiousness period
duration. This document will be repeatedly updated and the community is invited
to participate in improving it.

    <title>Simulating COVID-19 in a University Environment</title>
    <summary>  Residential colleges and universities face unique challenges in providing
in-person instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Administrators are
currently faced with decisions about whether to open during the pandemic and
what modifications of their normal operations might be necessary to protect
students, faculty and staff. There is little information, however, on what
measures are likely to be most effective and whether existing interventions
could contain the spread of an outbreak on campus. We develop a full-scale
stochastic agent-based model to determine whether in-person instruction could
safely continue during the pandemic and evaluate the necessity of various
interventions. Simulation results indicate that large scale randomized testing,
contact-tracing, and quarantining are important components of a successful
strategy for containing campus outbreaks. High test specificity is critical for
keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest
classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and
the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can
significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important
to control non-residential social exposure among students. Finally, necessarily
high quarantine rates even in controlled outbreaks imply significant
absenteeism, indicating a need to plan for remote instruction of quarantined
students.

    <title>Early epidemic spread, percolation and Covid-19</title>
    <summary>  Human to human transmissible infectious diseases spread in a population using
human interactions as its transmission vector. The early stages of such an
outbreak can be modeled by a graph whose edges encode these interactions
between individuals, the vertices. This article attempts to account for the
case when each individual entails in different kinds of interactions which have
therefore different probabilities of transmitting the disease. The majority of
these results can be also stated in the language of percolation theory.
  The main contributions of the article are: (1) Extend to this setting some
results which were previously known in the case when each individual has only
one kind of interactions. (2) Find an explicit formula for the basic
reproduction number $R_0$ which depends only on the probabilities of
transmitting the disease along the different edges and the first two moments of
the degree distributions of the associated graphs. (3) Motivated by the recent
Covid-19 pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the $R_0$ of a
model disease spreading in populations whose trees and degree distributions are
adjusted to several different countries. In this setting, we shall also compute
the probability that the outbreak will not lead to an epidemic. In all cases we
find such probability to be very low if no interventions are put in place.

    <title>Automatic classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19
  pneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray image: combination of data
  augmentation methods</title>
    <summary>  Purpose: This study aimed to develop and validate computer-aided diagnosis
(CXDx) system for classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19
pneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray (CXR) images.
  Materials and Methods: From two public datasets, 1248 CXR images were
obtained, which included 215, 533, and 500 CXR images of COVID-19 pneumonia
patients, non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and the healthy samples. The
proposed CADx system utilized VGG16 as a pre-trained model and combination of
conventional method and mixup as data augmentation methods. Other types of
pre-trained models were compared with the VGG16-based model. Single type or no
data augmentation methods were also evaluated. Splitting of
training/validation/test sets was used when building and evaluating the CADx
system. Three-category accuracy was evaluated for test set with 125 CXR images.
  Results: The three-category accuracy of the CAD system was 83.6% between
COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy. Sensitivity for
COVID-19 pneumonia was more than 90%. The combination of conventional method
and mixup was more useful than single type or no data augmentation method.
  Conclusion: This study was able to create an accurate CADx system for the
3-category classification. Source code of our CADx system is available as open
source for COVID-19 research.

    <title>Modeling strict age-targeted mitigation strategies for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We use a simple SIR-like epidemic model which integrates known age-contact
patterns for the United States to model the effect of age-targeted mitigation
strategies for a COVID-19-like epidemic. We find that, among strategies which
end with population immunity, strict age-targeted mitigation strategies have
the potential to greatly reduce mortalities and ICU utilization for natural
parameter choices.

    <title>Some fractal thoughts about the COVID-19 infection outbreak</title>
    <summary>  Some ideas are presented about the physical motivation of the apparent
capacity of generalized logistic equations to describe the outbreak of the
COVID-19 infection, and in general of quite many other epidemics. The main
focuses here are: the complex, possibly fractal, structure of the locus
describing the "contagion event set"; what can be learnt from the models of
trophic webs with "herd behaviour".

    <title>Visual explanation of country specific differences in Covid-19 dynamics</title>
    <summary>  This report provides a visual examination of Covid-19 case and death data. In
particular, it shows that country specific differences can too a large extend
be explained by two easily interpreted parameters. Namely, the delay between
reported cases and deaths and the fraction of cases observed. Furthermore, this
allows to lower bound the actual total number of people already infected.

    <summary>  To model the evolution of diseases with extended latency periods and the
presence of asymptomatic patients like COVID-19, we define a simple discrete
time stochastic SIR-type epidemic model. We include both latent periods as well
as the presence of quarantine areas, to capture the evolutionary dynamics of

    <title>COVID-19 Real-Time Tracker and Analytical Report</title>
    <summary>  While the COVID-19 outbreak was reported to first originate from Wuhan,
China, it has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 by WHO, and it has spread to over 180
countries by the time of this paper was being composed. As the disease spreads
around the globe, it has evolved into a world-wide pandemic, endangering the
state of global public health and becoming a serious threat to the global
community. To combat and prevent the spread of the disease, all individuals
should be well-informed of the rapidly changing state of COVID-19. In the
endeavor of accomplishing this objective, a COVID-19 real-time analytical
tracker has been built to provide the latest status of the disease and relevant
analytical insights. The real-time tracker is designed to cater to the general
audience without advanced statistical aptitude. It aims to communicate insights
through various straightforward and concise data visualizations that are
supported by sound statistical foundations and reliable data sources. This
paper aims to discuss the major methodologies which are utilized to generate
the insights displayed on the real-time tracker, which include real-time data
retrieval, normalization techniques, ARIMA time-series forecasting, and
logistic regression models. In addition to introducing the details and
motivations of the utilized methodologies, the paper additionally features some
key discoveries that have been derived in regard to COVID-19 using the
methodologies.

    <title>The comparison of trends in Spain and the Nederland: a Dynamical
  compartment model of the transmission of Coronavirus</title>
    <summary>  The recent spreading of coronavirus made many countries impose restrictions
in order to control its dangerous effect on the citizens. We developed a
theoretical dynamical model based on compartmental SIR system with additional
adjustment taken from Flow network and Markov chain frameworks to illustrate
developments and trends based on publicly available data. Based on this Model,
code in R was written and fed by stamped publicly available data from
authorized governmental websites in Spain and in the Nederlands, to compare
trends. Our results show that the 'peak' of infection is already behind us in
both countries, but also demonstrate that there is a danger of rebound of a
spread. It is obvious that measures imposed are giving the results, but we
should be precarious of near future practices and developments since the
majority of population will still be without immunity.

    <title>Not even the air of empty spaces is coronavirus free (Two meters is not
  a safe distance)</title>
    <summary>  A key safety measure encouraged by health authorities to avoid the SARS-CoV-2
spreading is the distance of one to two meters between people. This recommended
two-meters distance is mainly based on short-distance contagion, when infected
drops are expelled during a speech, coughing, or sneezing and directly hit
another person. The dangerous form of airway contamination caused by droplets
that remain suspended in the air for several hours has been almost ignored.
However, the theoretical calculations performed in this work, recent
experiments, and the accumulated knowledge in this and other epidemics indicate
that, because of the airborne transmission, there is no safe distance to the
coronavirus, either indoors or in open places. Recent investigations have
confirmed not only the presence of the coronavirus in droplets suspended in the
air but that these viruses remain active for several hours. Furthermore,
significant indirect evidence of this means of transmission is the great
difference in contagion between Brazilian regions in the current outbreak.
While the Amazonian states have a contamination rate greater than 20%, in the
southern states of the country this rate is less than 1%, despite high
temperatures in the Northern region. Notwithstanding the social and economic
differences between these regions, it seems that the extremely high humidity of
the forest air prolongs the survival of the viruses in the drops in the
external environment. Our theoretical calculations explain empirical
observations from recent epidemiological studies and strengthen the need to
use, not only a mask but also protective glasses throughout the population in
the same way that they are mandatory for health professionals. Besides, our
calculations show how air conditioning and heating systems can increase
contagion. Finally, we suggest measures that could reduce the spread of the
pandemic.

    <title>Finding Covid-19 from Chest X-rays using Deep Learning on a Small
  Dataset</title>
    <summary>  Testing for COVID-19 has been unable to keep up with the demand. Further, the
false negative rate is projected to be as high as 30% and test results can take
some time to obtain. X-ray machines are widely available and provide images for
diagnosis quickly. This paper explores how useful chest X-ray images can be in
diagnosing COVID-19 disease. We have obtained 122 chest X-rays of COVID-19 and
over 4,000 chest X-rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia. A pretrained deep
convolutional neural network has been tuned on 102 COVID-19 cases and 102 other
pneumonia cases in a 10-fold cross validation. The results were all 102
COVID-19 cases were correctly classified and there were 8 false positives
resulting in an AUC of 0.997. On a test set of 20 unseen COVID-19 cases all
were correctly classified and more than 95% of 4171 other pneumonia examples
were correctly classified. This study has flaws, most critically a lack of
information about where in the disease process the COVID-19 cases were and the
small data set size. More COVID-19 case images will enable a better answer to
the question of how useful chest X-rays can be for diagnosing COVID-19 (so
please send them).

    <title>Mutations strengthened SARS-CoV-2 infectivity</title>
    <summary>  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is a
major concern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and economic
reopening. However, rigorous determination of SARS-COV-2 infectivity is
essentially impossible owing to its continuous evolution with over 13752 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in six different subtypes. We develop
an advanced machine learning algorithm based on the algebraic topology to
quantitatively evaluate the binding affinity changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor following the mutations. Based on mutation-induced binding affinity
changes, we reveal that five out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become either
moderately or slightly more infectious, while one subtype has weakened its
infectivity. We find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV
according to computed S protein-ACE2 binding affinity changes. Based on a
systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein
receptor-binding domain (RBD), we show that most likely future mutations will
make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability
analysis, and binding affinity calculation, we predict that a few residues on
the receptor-binding motif (RBM), i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have very
high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.

    <title>Mapping the Landscape of Artificial Intelligence Applications against
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been declared a
pandemic by the World Health Organization, with over 2.5 million confirmed
cases as of April 23, 2020. In this review, we present an overview of recent
studies using Machine Learning and, more broadly, Artificial Intelligence, to
tackle many aspects of the COVID-19 crisis at different scales including
molecular, clinical, and societal applications. We also review datasets, tools,
and resources needed to facilitate AI research. Finally, we discuss strategic
considerations related to the operational implementation of projects,
multidisciplinary partnerships, and open science. We highlight the need for
international cooperation to maximize the potential of AI in this and future
pandemics.

    <title>Stochastic modeling and estimation of COVID-19 population dynamics</title>
    <summary>  The aim of the paper is to describe a model of the development of the
Covid-19 contamination of the population of a country or a region. For this
purpose a special branching process with two types of individuals is
considered. This model is intended to use only the observed daily statistics to
estimate the main parameter of the contamination and to give a prediction of
the mean value of the non-observed population of the contaminated individuals.
This is a serious advantage in comparison with other more complicated models
where the observed official statistics are not sufficient. In this way the
specific development of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered for different
countries.

    <title>Wisdom of the crowds in forecasting COVID-19 spreading severity</title>
    <summary>  In this work we report that the public reacted on social media at an early
stage of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the virus responsible of COVID-19, in a
surprisingly accurate way. Early social media activity levels reflected the
severity of the disease as registered almost a month later. Specifically, the
intensity of COVID-19 related social media activity from different Italian,
Spanish and United States regions at the beginning of the epidemic, predicts
well the total number of deaths reached almost a month later in each region.
More strikingly, at the time of the initial twitter reaction no tabled regional
data on the epidemic was readily available in Italy. By the 24th February 2020
only two regions reported death cases and only three reported infected
subjects. Our findings could underpin the creation of real-time novelty
detection systems aimed at early reporting of SARS-like mortality and thus
early activation of control measures in future pandemics.

    <title>COVID-19 in a social reinsurance framework: Forewarned is forearmed</title>
    <summary>  The crisis caused by COVID-19 revealed the global unpreparedness to handle
the impact of a pandemic. In this paper, we present a statistical analysis of
the data related to the COVID-19 outbreak in China, specifically the infection
speed, death and fatality rates in Hubei province. By fitting distributions of
these quantities we design a parametric reinsurance contract whose trigger and
cap are based on the probability distributions of the infection speed, death
and fatality rates. In particular, fitting the distribution for the infection
speed and death rates we provide a measure of the effectiveness of a state's
action during an epidemic, and propose a reinsurance contract as a supplement
to a state's social insurance to alleviate financial costs.

    <title>Holding a Conference Online and Live due to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The joint EDBT/ICDT conference (International Conference on Extending
Database Technology/International Conference on Database Theory) is a well
established conference series on data management, with annual meetings in the
second half of March that attract 250 to 300 delegates. Three weeks before
EDBT/ICDT 2020 was planned to take place in Copenhagen, the rapidly developing
Covid-19 pandemic led to the decision to cancel the face-to-face event. In the
interest of the research community, it was decided to move the conference
online while trying to preserve as much of the real-life experience as
possible. As far as we know, we are one of the first conferences that moved to
a fully synchronous online experience due to the COVID-19 outbreak. With fully
synchronous, we mean that participants jointly listened to presentations, had
live Q&amp;A, and attended other live events associated with the conference. In
this report, we share our decisions, experiences, and lessons learned.

    <title>Visualization of Diseases at Risk in the COVID-19 Literature</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a project, named VIDAR-19, able to extract automatically
diseases from the CORD-19 dataset, and also diseases which might be considered
as risk factors. The project relies on the ICD-11 classification of diseases
maintained by the WHO. This nomenclature is used as a data source of the
extraction mechanism, and also as the repository for the results. Developed for
the COVID-19, the project has the ability to extract diseases at risk and to
calculate relevant indicators. The outcome of the project is presented in a
dashboard which enables the user to explore graphically diseases at risk which
are put back in the classification hierarchy. Beyond the COVID-19, VIDAR has
much broader applications and might be directly used for any corpus dealing
with other pathologies.

    <title>Did COVID-19 infections decline before UK lockdown?</title>
    <summary>  The number of new infections per day is a key quantity for effective epidemic
management. It can be estimated by testing of random population samples.
Without such direct epidemiological measurement, other approaches are required
to infer whether the number of new cases is likely to be increasing or
decreasing: for example, estimating the pathogen reproductive rate, R, using
data gathered from the clinical response to the disease. For COVID-19 such R
estimation is heavily dependent on modelling assumptions, because the available
clinical case data are opportunistic observational data subject to severe
temporal confounding. Given this difficulty it is useful to reconstruct the
time course of infections from the least compromised available data, using
minimal prior assumptions. A Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK
data on COVID-19 deaths and the published disease duration distribution
suggests that infections were in decline before UK lockdown, and that
infections in Sweden started to decline only a short time later.

    <title>Arctic Oscillation: possible trigger of COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <summary>  The current COVID-19 pandemic is having detrimental consequences worldwide.
The pandemic started to develop strongly by the end of January and beginning of
February 2020, first in China with subsequent rapid spread to other countries
with new epicenters of the outbreaks concentrated mainly within the 30-50
degrees North latitudinal band (e.g., South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain).
Simultaneously, an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing at
latitudes around 40 degrees North was observed on global scale, in line with an
anomalously strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. This atypical
situation could have resulted in favorable meteorological conditions for a
quicker spread of the virus over the latitude band detailed above. This
possible connection needs further attention in order to understand the
meteorological and climatological factors related to the COVID-19 outbreak, and
for anticipating the spatio-temporal distribution of possible future pandemics.

    <title>Causal Modeling of Twitter Activity During COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the characteristics of public attention and perception is an
essential prerequisite for appropriate crisis management during adverse health
events. This is even more crucial during a pandemic such as COVID-19, as
primary responsibility of risk management is not centralized to a single
institution, but distributed across society. While numerous studies utilize
Twitter data in descriptive or predictive context during COVID-19 pandemic,
causal modeling of public attention has not been investigated. In this study,
we propose a causal inference approach to discover and quantify causal
relationships between pandemic characteristics (e.g. number of infections and
deaths) and Twitter activity as well as public sentiment. Our results show that
the proposed method can successfully capture the epidemiological domain
knowledge and identify variables that affect public attention and perception.
We believe our work contributes to the field of infodemiology by distinguishing
events that correlate with public attention from events that cause public
attention.

    <title>A Critical Assessment of Some Recent Work on COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  I tentatively re-analyze data from two well-publicized studies on COVID-19,
namely the Charit\'{e} "viral load in children" and the Bonn "seroprevalence in
Heinsberg/Gangelt" study, from information available in the preprints. The
studies have the following in common:
  - They received worldwide attention and arguably had policy impact.
  - The thrusts of their findings align with the respective lead authors'
(different) public stances on appropriate response to COVID-19.
  - Tentatively, my reading of the Gangelt study neutralizes its thrust, and my
reading of the Charit\'{e} study reverses it.
  The exercise may aid in placing these studies in the literature. With all
caveats that apply to n=2 quickfire analyses based off preprints, one also
wonders whether it illustrates inadvertent effects of "researcher degrees of
freedom."

    <title>Cross-lingual Transfer Learning for COVID-19 Outbreak Alignment</title>
    <summary>  The spread of COVID-19 has become a significant and troubling aspect of
society in 2020. With millions of cases reported across countries, new
outbreaks have occurred and followed patterns of previously affected areas.
Many disease detection models do not incorporate the wealth of social media
data that can be utilized for modeling and predicting its spread. In this case,
it is useful to ask, can we utilize this knowledge in one country to model the
outbreak in another? To answer this, we propose the task of cross-lingual
transfer learning for epidemiological alignment. Utilizing both macro and micro
text features, we train on Italy's early COVID-19 outbreak through Twitter and
transfer to several other countries. Our experiments show strong results with
up to 0.85 Spearman correlation in cross-country predictions.

    <title>Risk Attitudes and Human Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Behavioral responses to pandemics are less shaped by actual mortality or
hospitalization risks than they are by risk attitudes. We explore human
mobility patterns as a measure of behavioral responses during the COVID-19
pandemic. Our results indicate that risk-taking attitude is a critical factor
in predicting reduction in human mobility and increase social confinement
around the globe. We find that the sharp decline in movement after the WHO
(World Health Organization) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic can be
attributed to risk attitudes. Our results suggest that regions with risk-averse
attitudes are more likely to adjust their behavioral activity in response to
the declaration of a pandemic even before most official government lockdowns.
Further understanding of the basis of responses to epidemics, e.g.,
precautionary behavior, will help improve the containment of the spread of the
virus.

    <title>Geospatial Spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory disease that the World Health
Organization has declared a pandemic. Although a global phenomenon, there is
the need to react locally with swift and informed actions, as some of the
essential plans are highly dependent on factors such as culture, geography,
laws, and customs. This paper presents our approach to mapping the geospatial
spread of COVID-19 in Mexico at the state and municipal level, the highest
allowed possible resolution in the publicly available dataset provided by the
Health Ministry. To visualize the magnitude of the infection, we offer a map
for the confirmed positive, pending, and deceases cases, while to support
mobility, we provide a geospatial visualization of $R_t$, the basic
reproduction number. This document describes the structure of the dataset, the
software tools employed, and a description of the functionality of the maps,
which definition we make publicly available.

    <title>Regulation of interferon production as a potential strategy for COVID-19
  treatment</title>
    <summary>  Regulating the upstream of the cytokines production could be a promising
strategy to the treatment of COVID-19. We suggest to pay more attention to the
dysregulated IFN-I production in COVID-19 and to considerate cGAS, ALK and
STING as potential therapeutic targets preventing cytokine storm. Approved
drugs like suramin and ALK inhibitors are worthy of clinical trials.

    <title>Impact studies of nationwide measures COVID-19 anti-pandemic:
  compartmental model and machine learning</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we deal with the study of the impact of worldwide nation
measures for COVID-19 anti-pandemic. We drive two processes to analyze COVID-19
data considering measures, and then forecasting is done for Senegal. We show a
comparison between deterministic and two machine learning technics for
forecasting.

    <title>Space-time dependence of corona virus (COVID-19) outbreak</title>
    <summary>  We analyse the data for the global corona virus (COVID-19) outbreak using the
results of a previously studied Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model of
epidemic spreading on Euclidean networks. We also directly study the
correlation of the distance from the epicenter and the number of cases. An
inverse square law is seen to exist approximately. The studies are made for
China and the rest of the world separately.

    <title>Optimal quarantine strategies for COVID-19 control models</title>
    <summary>  Optimal control problems reflecting the finding of effective quarantine
strategies are considered for two control SEIR~type models describing the
spread of the COVID-19 virus in the human population. The properties of the
corresponding optimal controls are established analytically by applying the
Pontryagin maximum principle. The optimal solutions are obtained numerically
using BOCOP 2.0.5 software. The behavior of the appropriate optimal solutions
and their dependence on the basic reproductive ratio and length of quarantine
are discussed in detail. Necessary conclusions are made.

    <title>COVID-19 causes record decline in global CO2 emissions</title>
    <summary>  The considerable cessation of human activities during the COVID-19 pandemic
has affected global energy use and CO2 emissions. Here we show the
unprecedented decrease in global fossil CO2 emissions from January to April
2020 was of 7.8% (938 Mt CO2 with a +6.8% of 2-{\sigma} uncertainty) when
compared with the period last year. In addition other emerging estimates of
COVID impacts based on monthly energy supply or estimated parameters, this
study contributes to another step that constructed the near-real-time daily CO2
emission inventories based on activity from power generation (for 29
countries), industry (for 73 countries), road transportation (for 406 cities),
aviation and maritime transportation and commercial and residential sectors
emissions (for 206 countries). The estimates distinguished the decline of CO2
due to COVID-19 from the daily, weekly and seasonal variations as well as the
holiday events. The COVID-related decreases in CO2 emissions in road
transportation (340.4 Mt CO2, -15.5%), power (292.5 Mt CO2, -6.4% compared to
2019), industry (136.2 Mt CO2, -4.4%), aviation (92.8 Mt CO2, -28.9%),
residential (43.4 Mt CO2, -2.7%), and international shipping (35.9Mt CO2,
-15%). Regionally, decreases in China were the largest and earliest (234.5 Mt
CO2,-6.9%), followed by Europe (EU-27 &amp; UK) (138.3 Mt CO2, -12.0%) and the U.S.
(162.4 Mt CO2, -9.5%). The declines of CO2 are consistent with regional
nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based
networks, but the calculated signal of emissions decreases (about 1Gt CO2) will
have little impacts (less than 0.13ppm by April 30, 2020) on the overserved
global CO2 concertation. However, with observed fast CO2 recovery in China and
partial re-opening globally, our findings suggest the longer-term effects on
CO2 emissions are unknown and should be carefully monitored using multiple
measures.

    <title>On the Generation of Medical Dialogues for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Under the pandemic of COVID-19, people experiencing COVID19-related symptoms
or exposed to risk factors have a pressing need to consult doctors. Due to
hospital closure, a lot of consulting services have been moved online. Because
of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online
consultations timely. To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical
dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations. We collected
two dialogue datasets -- CovidDialog -- (in English and Chinese respectively)
containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19. On these
two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer,
GPT, and BERT-GPT. Since the two COVID-19 dialogue datasets are small in size,
which bear high risk of overfitting, we leverage transfer learning to mitigate
data deficiency. Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer,
GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune
them on our CovidDialog tasks. We perform both automatic and human evaluation
of responses generated by these models. The results show that the generated
responses are promising in being doctor-like, relevant to the conversation
history, and clinically informative. The data and code are available at
https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-Dialogue.

    <title>A Two-Phase Dynamic Contagion Model for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a continuous-time stochastic intensity model,
namely, two-phase dynamic contagion process(2P-DCP), for modelling the epidemic
contagion of COVID-19 and investigating the lockdown effect based on the
dynamic contagion model introduced by Dassios and Zhao (2011). It allows
randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant
reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological
quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected
epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various
regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in
each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the
incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that
our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19.
More importantly, the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an
important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models
with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional
epidemic and worldwide pandemic.

    <title>A first look at COVID-19 information and misinformation sharing on
  Twitter</title>
    <summary>  Since December 2019, COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly across the world.
Not surprisingly, conversation about COVID-19 is also increasing. This article
is a first look at the amount of conversation taking place on social media,
specifically Twitter, with respect to COVID-19, the themes of discussion, where
the discussion is emerging from, myths shared about the virus, and how much of
it is connected to other high and low quality information on the Internet
through shared URL links. Our preliminary findings suggest that a meaningful
spatio-temporal relationship exists between information flow and new cases of
COVID-19, and while discussions about myths and links to poor quality
information exist, their presence is less dominant than other crisis specific
themes. This research is a first step toward understanding social media
conversation about COVID-19.

    <title>Deep Learning COVID-19 Features on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets</title>
    <summary>  Under the global pandemic of COVID-19, the use of artificial intelligence to
analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage is
becoming important. Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID-19
pandemic, a systematic collection of the CXR data set for deep neural network
training is difficult. To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based
convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of
trainable parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed method is inspired by
our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR
radiographs. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency
maps, which are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.

    <title>A Cascaded Learning Strategy for Robust COVID-19 Pneumonia Chest X-Ray
  Screening</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a comprehensive screening platform for the COVID-19 (a.k.a.,
SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. The proposed AI-based system works on chest x-ray (CXR)
images to predict whether a patient is infected with the COVID-19 disease.
Although the recent international joint effort on making the availability of
all sorts of open data, the public collection of CXR images is still relatively
small for reliably training a deep neural network (DNN) to carry out COVID-19
prediction. To better address such inefficiency, we design a cascaded learning
strategy to improve both the sensitivity and the specificity of the resulting
DNN classification model. Our approach leverages a large CXR image dataset of
non-COVID-19 pneumonia to generalize the original well-trained classification
model via a cascaded learning scheme. The resulting screening system is shown
to achieve good classification performance on the expanded dataset, including
those newly added COVID-19 CXR images.

    <title>Quantitative Relationship between Population Mobility and COVID-19
  Growth Rate based on 14 Countries</title>
    <summary>  This study develops a framework for quantification of the impact of changes
in population mobility due to social distancing on the COVID-19 infection
growth rate. Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological
model we establish that under some mild assumptions the growth rate of COVID-19
deaths is a time-delayed approximation of the growth rate of COVID-19
infections. We then hypothesize that the growth rate of COVID-19 infections is
a function of population mobility, which leads to a statistical model that
predicts the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths as a delayed function of population
mobility. The parameters of the statistical model directly reveal the growth
rate of infections, the mobility-dependent transmission rate, the
mobility-independent recovery rate, and the critical mobility, below which
COVID-19 growth rate becomes negative. We fitted the proposed statistical model
on publicly available data from 14 countries where daily death counts exceeded
100 for more than 3 days as of May 6th, 2020. The publicly available Google
Mobility Index (GMI) was used as a measure of population mobility at the
country level. Our results show that the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths can be
accurately estimated 20 days ahead as a quadratic function of the transit
category of GMI (adjusted R-squared = 0.784). The estimated 95% confidence
interval for the critical mobility is in the range between 36.1% and 47.6% of
the pre-COVID-19 mobility. This result indicates that a significant reduction
in population mobility is needed to reverse the growth of COVID-19 epidemic.
Moreover, the quantitative relationship established herein suggests that a
readily available, population-level metric such as GMI can be a useful
indicator of the course of COVID-19 epidemic.

    <title>Composite Monte Carlo Decision Making under High Uncertainty of Novel
  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction</title>
    <summary>  In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019,
governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions
under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)
simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are
broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many
possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability
distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested
cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities
around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the
population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds
and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is
reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of
a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and
the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case
study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule
induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development
is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a
MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction
of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited
from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell
about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.

    <title>Global dynamics of a SUIR model with predicting COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Since December 2019, A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been breaking out in
China, which can cause respiratory diseases and severe pneumonia. Epidemic
models relying on the incidence rate of new cases for forecasting epidemic
outbreaks have received increasing attention. However, many prior works in this
area mostly focus on the application of the traditional SIR model and disregard
the transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV, exceptionally the infectious of
undiagnosed cases. Here, we propose a SUIR model based on the classical SIR
model object to supervise the effective prediction, prevention, and control of
infectious diseases. SUIR model adds a unique $U$ (Undiagnosed) state of the
epidemic and divides the population into four states: S (Susceptible), U
(Undiagnosed), I (Infectious and Uninfectious), and R (Recovered). This
approach enables us to predict the incidence of 2019-nCoV effectively and the
clear advantage of the model accuracy more reliable than the traditional SIR
model.

    <title>Unveiling COVID-19 from Chest X-ray with deep learning: a hurdles race
  with small data</title>
    <summary>  The possibility to use widespread and simple chest X-ray (CXR) imaging for
early screening of COVID-19 patients is attracting much interest from both the
clinical and the AI community. In this study we provide insights and also raise
warnings on what is reasonable to expect by applying deep-learning to COVID
classification of CXR images. We provide a methodological guide and critical
reading of an extensive set of statistical results that can be obtained using
currently available datasets. In particular, we take the challenge posed by
current small size COVID data and show how significant can be the bias
introduced by transfer-learning using larger public non-COVID CXR datasets. We
also contribute by providing results on a medium size COVID CXR dataset, just
collected by one of the major emergency hospitals in Northern Italy during the
peak of the COVID pandemic. These novel data allow us to contribute to validate
the generalization capacity of preliminary results circulating in the
scientific community. Our conclusions shed some light into the possibility to
effectively discriminate COVID using CXR.

    <title>Triaging moderate COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias from routine blood
  tests</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 is sweeping the world with deadly consequences. Its contagious
nature and clinical similarity to other pneumonias make separating subjects
contracted with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia a priority and a
challenge. However, COVID-19 testing has been greatly limited by the
availability and cost of existing methods, even in developed countries like the
US. Intrigued by the wide availability of routine blood tests, we propose to
leverage them for COVID-19 testing using the power of machine learning. Two
proven-robust machine learning model families, random forests (RFs) and support
vector machines (SVMs), are employed to tackle the challenge. Trained on blood
data from 208 moderate COVID-19 subjects and 86 subjects with non-COVID-19
moderate viral pneumonia, the best result is obtained in an SVM-based
classifier with an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 80%,
and a precision of 92%. The results are found explainable from both machine
learning and medical perspectives. A privacy-protected web portal is set up to
help medical personnel in their practice and the trained models are released
for developers to further build other applications. We hope our results can
help the world fight this pandemic and welcome clinical verification of our
approach on larger populations.

    <title>Tracking the Twitter attention around the research efforts on the
  COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a bulk of
scientific research and related Twitter discussions. To unravel the public
concerns about the COVID-19 crisis reflected in the science-based Twitter
conversations, this study tracked the Twitter attention around the COVID-19
research efforts during the first three months of 2020. On the basis of nearly
1.4 million Twitter mentions of 6,162 COVID-19-related scientific publications,
we investigated the temporal tweeting dynamic and the Twitter users involved in
the online discussions around COVID-19-related research. The results show that
the quantity of Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related publications was on
rising. Scholarly-oriented Twitter users played an influential role in
disseminating research outputs on COVID-19, with their tweets being frequently
retweeted. Over time, a change in the focus of the Twitter discussions can be
observed, from the initial attention to virological and clinical research to
more practical topics, such as the potential treatments, the countermeasures by
the governments, the healthcare measures, and the influences on the economy and
society, in more recent times.

    <title>Hate multiverse spreads malicious COVID-19 content online beyond
  individual platform control</title>
    <summary>  We show that malicious COVID-19 content, including hate speech,
disinformation, and misinformation, exploits the multiverse of online hate to
spread quickly beyond the control of any individual social media platform.
Machine learning topic analysis shows quantitatively how online hate
communities are weaponizing COVID-19, with topics evolving rapidly and content
becoming increasingly coherent. Our mathematical analysis provides a
generalized form of the public health R0 predicting the tipping point for
multiverse-wide viral spreading, which suggests new policy options to mitigate
the global spread of malicious COVID-19 content without relying on future
coordination between all online platforms.

    <title>The geographic spread of COVID-19 correlates with structure of social
  networks as measured by Facebook</title>
    <summary>  We use anonymized and aggregated data from Facebook to show that areas with
stronger social ties to two early COVID-19 "hotspots" (Westchester County, NY,
in the U.S. and Lodi province in Italy) generally have more confirmed COVID-19
cases as of March 30, 2020. These relationships hold after controlling for
geographic distance to the hotspots as well as for the income and population
density of the regions. These results suggest that data from online social
networks may prove useful to epidemiologists and others hoping to forecast the
spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19.

    <title>Is the anti-filarial drug diethylcarbamazine useful to treat COVID-19?</title>
    <summary>  The SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a devastating pandemic of COVID-19.
Exploring compounds that could offer a breakthrough in treatment is the need of
the hour. Re-positioning cheap, freely available and safe drugs is a priority.
The paper proposes evidence for the potential use of diethylcarbamazine (DEC)
in the treatment of COVID-19. DEC has inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid
metabolism to prostaglandins, little known anti-viral effects on animal
retroviruses and demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions in animal models of
lung inflammation indicating the need to explore this hypothesis further. We
believe this is the first time DEC is being proposed to treat COVID-19.

    <title>CAiRE-COVID: A Question Answering and Multi-Document Summarization

    <summary>  To address the need for refined information in COVID-19 pandemic, we propose
a deep learning-based system that uses state-of-the-art natural language
processing (NLP) question answering (QA) techniques combined with summarization
for mining the available scientific literature. Our system leverages the

    <title>Classification Aware Neural Topic Model and its Application on a New
  COVID-19 Disinformation Corpus</title>
    <summary>  The explosion of disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic has
overloaded fact-checkers and media worldwide. To help tackle this, we developed
computational methods to support COVID-19 disinformation debunking and social
impacts research. This paper presents: 1) the currently largest available
manually annotated COVID-19 disinformation category dataset; and 2) a
classification-aware neural topic model (CANTM) that combines classification
and topic modelling under a variational autoencoder framework. We demonstrate
that CANTM efficiently improves classification performance with low resources,
and is scalable. In addition, the classification-aware topics help researchers
and end-users to better understand the classification results.

    <title>Robust and optimal predictive control of the COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <summary>  We investigate adaptive strategies to robustly and optimally control the
COVID-19 pandemic via social distancing measures based on the example of
Germany. Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of
two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model
of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and
validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control
policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to
simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more
realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy
that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a
reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant
parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using
interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and
safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are
inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social
distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing
that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the
COVID-19 outbreak, 2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the
number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of
social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social
distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than
opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.

    <title>COVID-19 and the Social Distancing Paradox: dangers and solutions</title>
    <summary>  Background: Without proven effect treatments and vaccines, Social Distancing
is the key protection factor against COVID-19. Social distancing alone should
have been enough to protect again the virus, yet things have gone very
differently, with a big mismatch between theory and practice. What are the
reasons? A big problem is that there is no actual social distancing data, and
the corresponding people behavior in a pandemic is unknown. We collect the
world-first dataset on social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak, so to
see for the first time how people really implement social distancing, identify
dangers of the current situation, and find solutions against this and future
pandemics.
  Methods: Using a sensor-based social distancing belt we collected social
distance data from people in Italy for over two months during the most critical
COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we investigated if and how wearing various
Personal Protection Equipment, like masks, influences social distancing.
  Results: Without masks, people adopt a counter-intuitively dangerous
strategy, a paradox that could explain the relative lack of effectiveness of
social distancing. Using masks radically changes the situation, breaking the
paradoxical behavior and leading to a safe social distance behavior. In
shortage of masks, DIY (Do It Yourself) masks can also be used: even without
filtering protection, they provide social distancing protection. Goggles should
be recommended for general use, as they give an extra powerful safety boost.
Generic Public Health policies and media campaigns do not work well on social
distancing: explicit focus on the behavioral problems of necessary mobility are
needed.

    <title>Global Data Science Project for COVID-19 Summary Report</title>
    <summary>  This paper aims at providing the summary of the Global Data Science Project
(GDSC) for COVID-19. as on May 31 2020. COVID-19 has largely impacted on our
societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy
measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the
multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including
people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has
changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and
quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at
international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international
level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has
plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of
flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United
States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating
countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March
10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major
city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain).
Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We
also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of
posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in
the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram
doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among
Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's
social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram
data and primary survey data.

    <title>Simulating the Spread of Epidemics in China on the Multi-layer
  Transportation Network: Beyond the Coronavirus in Wuhan</title>
    <summary>  Based on the SEIR model and the modeling of urban transportation networks, a
general-purpose simulator for the spread of epidemics in Chinese cities is
built. The Chinese public transportation system between over 340
prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with
layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail
routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities,
peripheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local
spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the
overlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different
transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the
transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation
vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the
infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the
recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be
used to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other
countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction
number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from
any Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective
government interventions are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to
trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from
empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. The
model is used to simulate the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan; it shows that
the framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public
city-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.

    <title>Trend and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak in China</title>
    <summary>  By using the public data from Jan. 20 to Feb. 11, 2020, we perform
data-driven analysis and forecasting on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland
China, especially Hubei province. Our results show that the turning points of
the daily infections are predicted to be Feb. 6 and Feb. 1, 2020, for Hubei and
China other than Hubei, respectively. The epidemic in China is predicted to end
up after Mar. 10, 2020, and the number of the total infections are predicted to
be 51600. The data trends reveal that quick and active strategies taken by
China to reduce human exposure have already had a good impact on the control of
the epidemic.

    <title>A Note on the Evolution of Covid-19 in Italy</title>
    <summary>  We employ methods largely exploited in Physics, in the analysis of the
evolution of dynamical systems, to study the pattern of the Covid-19 infection
in Italy. The techniques we employ are based on the use of logistic function
and of its derivative, namely the Hubbert function. The latter is exploited to
give a prediction on the number of infected per day. We also mention the
possibility of taking advantage from other mathematical tools based e.g. on the
Gompertz equation and make some comparison on the different predictive
capabilities.

    <title>Phenomenological analysis of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak dynamics</title>
    <summary>  In the wake of the COVID-19 virus outbreak, a brief phenomenological
(descriptive, comparative) analysis of the dynamics of the disease spread among
different countries is presented. Results indicate that the infection spread
dynamics is currently the most pronounced in the USA (confirmed cases are
currently doubling every 2.16 days, with a decreasing doubling time tendency),
while other countries with the most confirmed cases show different values, and
tendencies. The reported number of deaths is currently doubled every 2.28 days
in Germany, 2.56 days in France, 2.57 days in Switzerland, 2.59 days in France,
and 2.62 days in USA, while only France and USA are currently exhibiting
further acceleration (diminishing doubling time).

    <title>Model studies on the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden</title>
    <summary>  We study the increases of infections and deaths in Sweden caused by COVID-19
with several different models: Firstly an analytical susceptible-infected (SI)
model and the standard susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Then within
the SIR framework we study the susceptible-infected-deceased (SID)
correlations. All models reproduce well the number of infected cases and give
similar predictions. What causes us deep concern is the large number of deaths
projected by the SI and SID models. Our analysis shows that, irrespective of
the possible uncertainty of our model prediction, the next few days can be
critical for determining the future evolution of the death cases (Updated April
02).

    <title>Ending the COVID-19 epidemic in the United Kingdom</title>
    <summary>  Social distancing and lockdown are the two main non-pharmaceutical
interventions being used by the UK government to contain and control the
COVID-19 epidemic; these are being applied uniformly across the entire country,
even though the results of the Imperial College report by Ferguson et al show
that the impact of the infection increases sharply with age. This paper
develops a variant of the workhorse SIR model for epidemics, where the
population is classified into a number of age groups. This allows us to
understand the effects of age-dependent controls on the epidemic, and explore
possible exit strategies.

    <summary>  We consider variations in the rate of spread of COVID-19, firstly comparing
between European countries and secondly comparing between US states. We show
that the population density has a small but significant effect on the rate of
spread of the virus. However we show that measures of `lived population
density', which capture density as perceived by a randomly chosen person, do a
better job of explaining variations in the rate of spread, achieving $R^2 =
0.45$ in Europe. We show that adding further measures based on the timing of
the outbreak into the regression can increase this to $R^2 = 0.58$.

    <title>COVID-19 Contact Tracing: Eight Privacy Questions Explored</title>
    <summary>  We respond to a recent short paper by de Motjoye et el. on privacy issues
with Covid-19 tracking. Their paper, which we discuss here, is structured
around three "toy protocols" for the design of an app which can maximise the
utility of contact tracing information while minimising the more general risk
to privacy. On this basis, the paper proceeds to introduce eight questions
against which they should be assessed. The questions raised and the protocols
proposed effectively amount to the creation of a game with different categories
of players able to make different moves. It is therefore possible to analyse
the model in terms of optimal game design.

    <title>SEIRD Model for Qatar Covid-19 Outbreak: A Case Study</title>
    <summary>  The Covid-19 outbreak of 2020 has required many governments to develop
mathematical-statistical models of the outbreak for policy and planning
purposes. This work provides a tutorial on building a compartmental model using
Susceptibles, Exposed, Infected, Recovered and Deaths status through time. A
Bayesian Framework is utilized to perform both parameter estimation and
predictions. This model uses interventions to quantify the impact of various
government attempts to slow the spread of the virus. Predictions are also made
to determine when the peak Active Infections will occur.

    <title>Understanding the perception of COVID-19 policies by mining a
  multilanguage Twitter dataset</title>
    <summary>  The objective of this work is to explore popular discourse about the COVID-19
pandemic and policies implemented to manage it. Using Natural Language
Processing, Text Mining, and Network Analysis to analyze corpus of tweets that
relate to the COVID-19 pandemic, we identify common responses to the pandemic
and how these responses differ across time. Moreover, insights as to how
information and misinformation were transmitted via Twitter, starting at the
early stages of this pandemic, are presented. Finally, this work introduces a
dataset of tweets collected from all over the world, in multiple languages,
dating back to January 22nd, when the total cases of reported COVID-19 were
below 600 worldwide. The insights presented in this work could help inform
decision makers in the face of future pandemics, and the dataset introduced can
be used to acquire valuable knowledge to help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Using VERA to explain the impact of social distancing on the spread of
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 continues to spread across the country and around the world. Current
strategies for managing the spread of COVID-19 include social distancing. We
present VERA, an interactive AI tool, that first enables users to specify
conceptual models of the impact of social distancing on the spread of COVID-19.
Then, VERA automatically spawns agent-based simulations from the conceptual
models, and, given a data set, automatically fills in the values of the
simulation parameters from the data. Next, the user can view the simulation
results, and, if needed, revise the simulation parameters and run another
experimental trial, or build an alternative conceptual model. We describe the
use VERA to develop a SIR model for the spread of COVID-19 and its relationship
with healthcare capacity.

    <summary>  Epidemiologist, Scientists, Statisticians, Historians, Data engineers and
Data scientists are working on finding descriptive models and theories to
explain COVID-19 expansion phenomena or on building analytics predictive models
for learning the apex of COVID-19 confimed cases, recovered cases, and deaths
evolution curves. In CRISP-DM life cycle, 75% of time is consumed only by data
preparation phase causing lot of pressions and stress on scientists and data
scientists building machine learning models. This paper aims to help reducing
data preparation efforts by presenting detailed schemas design and data
preparation technical scripts for formatting and storing Johns Hopkins
University COVID-19 daily data in HBase NoSQL data store, and enabling HiveQL
COVID-19 data querying in a relational Hive SQL-like style.

    <title>Massive viral replication and cytopathic effects in early COVID-19
  pneumonia</title>
    <summary>  SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 acute respiratory illness that like its
predecessors, MERS and SARS, can be severe and fatal 1-4. By April of 2020,
COVID-19 infections had become a worldwide pandemic with nearly 3 million
infections and over 200,000 deaths. The relative contributions of virus
replication and cytopathic effects or immunopathological host responses to the
severe and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 lung infections have as yet to be
determined. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathic effects in
type II alveolar pneumocytes causes focal lung injury in an individual with no
history of pulmonary symptoms. These findings point to the potential benefit of
early effective antiviral treatment to prevent progression to severe and fatal
COVID-19 pneumonia.

    <title>COVID-Net: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for
  Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-Ray Images</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health
and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against
COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key
screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography.
Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research
community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural
network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray
(CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source
network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial
release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we
generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases,
with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the
best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes
predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain
deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can
aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible
and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on
relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready
solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the
description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged
and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to
accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning
solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who
need it the most.

    <title>Weather-inspired ensemble-based probabilistic prediction of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The objective of this work is to predict the spread of COVID-19 starting from
observed data, using a forecast method inspired by probabilistic weather
prediction systems operational today.
  Results show that this method works well for China: on day 25 we could have
predicted well the outcome for the next 35 days. The same method has been
applied to Italy and South Korea, and forecasts for the forthcoming weeks are
included in this work. For Italy, forecasts based on data collected up to today
(24 March) indicate that number of observed cases could grow from the current
value of 69,176, to between 101k-180k, with a 50% probability of being between
110k-135k. For South Korea, it suggests that the number of observed cases could
grow from the current value of 9,018 (as of the 23rd of March), to values
between 8,500 and 9,300, with a 50% probability of being between 8,700 and
8,900.
  We conclude by suggesting that probabilistic disease prediction systems are
possible and could be developed following key ideas and methods from weather
forecasting. Having access to skilful daily updated forecasts could help taking
better informed decisions on how to manage the spread of diseases such as
COVID-19.

    <title>A phenomenological approach to COVID-19 spread in a population</title>
    <summary>  A phenomenological model to describe the Corona Virus(covid-19) Pandemic
spread in a given population is developed. It enables the identification of the
key quantities required to form adequate policies for control and mitigation in
terms of observable parameters using the Landau-Stuart equation. It is intended
to be complementary to detailed simulations and methods published recently by
Ferguson and collaborators, March 16, (2020). The results suggest that the
initial growth/spreading rate gamma-c of the disease, and the fraction of
infected persons in the population p-i can be used to define a
`retardation/inhibition coefficient' k-star , which is a measure of the
effectiveness of the control policies adopted.
  The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python
code. The solutions provide both qualitative and quantitative information. They
substantiate and justify two basic control policies enunciated by WHO and
adopted in many countries: a) Systematic and early intensive testing
individuals for covid-19 and b) Sequestration policies such as `social/physical
distancing' and population density reduction by strict quarantining are
essential for making k-star greater than 1, necessary for suppressing the
pandemic. The model indicates that relaxing such measures when the infection
rate starts to decrease as a result of earlier policies could simply restart
the infection rate in the non-infected population. Presently available
available statistical data in WHO and other reports can be readily used to
determine the the key parameters of the model. Possible extensions to the basic
model to make it more realistic are indicated.

    <title>Measuring Emotions in the COVID-19 Real World Worry Dataset</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic is having a dramatic impact on societies and economies
around the world. With various measures of lockdowns and social distancing in
place, it becomes important to understand emotional responses on a large scale.
In this paper, we present the first ground truth dataset of emotional responses
to COVID-19. We asked participants to indicate their emotions and express these
in text. This resulted in the Real World Worry Dataset of 5,000 texts (2,500
short + 2,500 long texts). Our analyses suggest that emotional responses
correlated with linguistic measures. Topic modeling further revealed that
people in the UK worry about their family and the economic situation.
Tweet-sized texts functioned as a call for solidarity, while longer texts shed
light on worries and concerns. Using predictive modeling approaches, we were
able to approximate the emotional responses of participants from text within
14% of their actual value. We encourage others to use the dataset and improve
how we can use automated methods to learn about emotional responses and worries
about an urgent problem.

    <title>Campus Traffic and e-Learning during COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic led to the adoption of severe measures to counteract
the spread of the infection. Social distancing and lockdown measures modifies
people's habits, while the Internet gains a major role to support remote
working, e-teaching, online collaboration, gaming, video streaming, etc. All
these sudden changes put unprecedented stress on the network. In this paper we
analyze the impact of the lockdown enforcement on the Politecnico di Torino
campus network. Right after the school shutdown on the 25th of February, PoliTO
deployed its own in-house solution for virtual teaching. Ever since, the
university provides about 600 virtual classes daily, serving more than 16,000
students per day. Here, we report a picture of how the pandemic changed
PoliTO's network traffic. We first focus on the usage of remote working and
collaborative platforms. Given the peculiarity of PoliTO in-house online
teaching solution, we drill down on it, characterizing both the audience and
the network footprint. Overall, we present a snapshot of the abrupt changes on
campus traffic and learning due to COVID-19, and testify how the Internet has
proved robust to successfully cope with challenges and maintain the university
operations.

    <title>Optimal Covid-19 Pool Testing with a priori Information</title>
    <summary>  As humanity struggles to contain the global Covid-19 infection, prophylactic
actions are grandly slowed down by the shortage of testing kits. Governments
have taken several measures to work around this shortage: the FDA has become
more liberal on the approval of Covid-19 tests in the US. In the UK emergency
measures allowed to increase the daily number of locally produced test kits to
100,000. China has recently launched a massive test manufacturing program.
However, all those efforts are very insufficient and many poor countries are
still under threat. A popular method for reducing the number of tests consists
in pooling samples, i.e. mixing patient samples and testing the mixed samples
once. If all the samples are negative, pooling succeeds at a unitary cost.
However, if a single sample is positive, failure does not indicate which
patient is infected. This paper describes how to optimally detect infected
patients in pools, i.e. using a minimal number of tests to precisely identify
them, given the a priori probabilities that each of the patients is healthy.
Those probabilities can be estimated using questionnaires, supervised machine
learning or clinical examinations. The resulting algorithms, which can be
interpreted as informed divide-and-conquer strategies, are non-intuitive and
quite surprising. They are patent-free. Co-authors are listed in alphabetical
order.

    <title>COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Privacy: Studying Opinion and Preferences</title>
    <summary>  There is growing interest in technology-enabled contact tracing, the process
of identifying potentially infected COVID-19 patients by notifying all recent
contacts of an infected person. Governments, technology companies, and research
groups alike recognize the potential for smartphones, IoT devices, and wearable
technology to automatically track "close contacts" and identify prior contacts
in the event of an individual's positive test. However, there is currently
significant public discussion about the tensions between effective
technology-based contact tracing and the privacy of individuals. To inform this
discussion, we present the results of a sequence of online surveys focused on
contact tracing and privacy, each with 100 participants. Our first surveys were
on April 1 and 3, and we report primarily on those first two surveys, though we
present initial findings from later survey dates as well. Our results present
the diversity of public opinion and can inform the public discussion on whether
and how to leverage technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We are
continuing to conduct longitudinal measurements, and will update this report
over time; citations to this version of the report should reference Report

    <title>Statistical Decision Properties of Imprecise Trials Assessing COVID-19
  Drugs</title>
    <summary>  As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, researchers are reporting findings of
randomized trials comparing standard care with care augmented by experimental
drugs. The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects
are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may
find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs.
Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that
random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal
treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an
innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect
is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard
care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of
near-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of
decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the
empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed
average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and
ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields
treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by
prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.

    <title>Modeling COVID-19 dynamics in Illinois under non-pharmaceutical
  interventions</title>
    <summary>  We present modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Illinois, USA, capturing the
implementation of a Stay-at-Home order and scenarios for its eventual release.
We use a non-Markovian age-of-infection model that is capable of handling long
and variable time delays without changing its model topology. Bayesian
estimation of model parameters is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods. This framework allows us to treat all available input
information, including both the previously published parameters of the epidemic
and available local data, in a uniform manner. To accurately model deaths as
well as demand on the healthcare system, we calibrate our predictions to total
and in-hospital deaths as well as hospital and ICU bed occupancy by COVID-19
patients. We apply this model not only to the state as a whole but also its
sub-regions in order to account for the wide disparities in population size and
density. Without prior information on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs),
the model independently reproduces a mitigation trend closely matching mobility
data reported by Google and Unacast. Forward predictions of the model provide
robust estimates of the peak position and severity and also enable forecasting
the regional-dependent results of releasing Stay-at-Home orders. The resulting
highly constrained narrative of the epidemic is able to provide estimates of
its unseen progression and inform scenarios for sustainable monitoring and
control of the epidemic.

    <title>The Impact of COVID-19 on Flight Networks</title>
    <summary>  As COVID-19 transmissions spread worldwide, governments have announced and
enforced travel restrictions to prevent further infections. Such restrictions
have a direct effect on the volume of international flights among these
countries, resulting in extensive social and economic costs. To better
understand the situation in a quantitative manner, we used the Opensky network
data to clarify flight patterns and flight densities around the world and
observe relationships between flight numbers with new infections, and with the
economy (unemployment rate) in Barcelona. We found that the number of daily
flights gradually decreased and suddenly dropped 64% during the second half of
March in 2020 after the US and Europe enacted travel restrictions. We also
observed a 51% decrease in the global flight network density decreased during
this period. Regarding new COVID-19 cases, the world had an unexpected surge
regardless of travel restrictions. Finally, the layoffs for temporary workers
in the tourism and airplane business increased by 4.3 fold in the weeks
following Spain's decision to close its borders.

    <title>COVID-19 and Digital Resilience: Evidence from Uber Eats</title>
    <summary>  We analyze how digital platforms can increase the survival rate of firms
during a crisis by providing continuity in access to customers. Using
order-level data from Uber Technologies, we study how the COVID-19 pandemic and
the ensuing shutdown of businesses in the United States affected independent,
small business restaurant supply and demand on the Uber Eats platform. We find
evidence that small restaurants experience significant increases in total
activity, orders per day, and orders per hour following the closure of the
dine-in channel, and that these increases may be due to both demand-side and
supply-side shocks. We document an increase in the intensity of competitive
effects following the shock, showing that growth in the number of providers on
a platform induces both market expansion and heightened inter-provider
competition. Our findings underscore the critical role that digital will play
in creating business resilience in the post-COVID economy, and provide new
managerial insight into how supply-side and demand-side factors shape business
performance on a platform.

    <title>COVID-19 Mobility Data Collection of Seoul, South Korea</title>
    <summary>  The relationship between pandemic and human mobility has received
considerable attention from scholars, as investigating such relationship can
provide an indication of how human mobility changes in response to a public
health crisis or whether reduced mobility contributes to preventing the spread
of an infectious disease. While several studies attempted to unveil this
relationship, no studies have focused on changes in mobility pattern at a finer
scale utilizing high-resolution datasets. To address the complex association
between pandemic's spread and human mobility, this paper presents two
categories of mobility datasets-trip mode and trip purpose-that concern nearly
10 million citizens' movements during the first 100 days of COVID-19 in Seoul,
South Korea, where no major lockdown has been imposed. We curate hourly data of
subway ridership, traffic volume and population present count at selected
points of interests. The results to be derived from the presented datasets can
be used as an important reference for public health decision making in the post
COVID-19 era.

    <title>A Survey of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps</title>
    <summary>  The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has taken the world by surprise, forcing
lockdowns and straining public health care systems. COVID-19 is known to be a
highly infectious virus, and infected individuals do not initially exhibit
symptoms, while some remain asymptomatic. Thus, a non-negligible fraction of
the population can, at any given time, be a hidden source of transmissions. In
response, many governments have shown great interest in smartphone contact
tracing apps that help automate the difficult task of tracing all recent
contacts of newly identified infected individuals. However, tracing apps has
generated much discussion around their key attributes, including system
architecture, data management, privacy, security, proximity estimation, and
attack vulnerability. In this article, we provide the first comprehensive
review of these much-discussed tracing app attributes. We also present an
overview of many proposed tracing app examples, some of which have been
deployed countrywide, and discuss the concerns users have reported regarding
their usage. We close by outlining potential research directions for
next-generation app design, which would facilitate improved tracing and
security performance, as well as wide adoption by the population at large.

    <title>Modelling Recovered Cases and Death Probabilities for the COVID-19
  Outbreak</title>
    <summary>  From March 23rd, the data for the recovered cases of COVID-19 are missing
from the standard repository maintained by the Johns Hopkins University in
collaboration with the WHO. But since data concerning recovered patients are
extremely important for modelling the COVID-19 outbreak, a method for
estimating the missing data is provided and tested. As a byproduct, it produces
estimates for the probabilities to die $k$ days after confirmation, or to
survive after $d$ days.

Tomography (CT) based test has emerged as a promising alternative to the gold
standard RT-PCR test. However, it is primarily provided in hospital setting due
to the need for expensive equipment and experienced radiologists. An accurate,
rapid yet inexpensive test that is suitable for COVID-19 population screenings
at mobile, urgent and primary care clinics is urgently needed. We present
COVID-MobileXpert: a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) based mobile app
that can use noisy snapshots of chest X-ray (CXR) for point-of-care COVID-19
screening. We design and implement a novel three-player knowledge transfer and
distillation (KTD) framework including a pre-trained attending physician (AP)
network that extracts CXR imaging features from large scale of lung disease CXR
images, a fine-tuned resident fellow (RF) network that learns the essential CXR
imaging features to discriminate COVID-19 from pneumonia and/or normal cases
using a small amount of COVID-19 cases, and a trained lightweight medical
student (MS) network that performs on-device COVID-19 screening. To accommodate
the need for screening using noisy snapshots of CXR images, we employ novel
loss functions and training schemes for the MS network to learn the robust
imaging features for accurate on-device COVID-19 screening. We demonstrate the
strong potential of COVID-MobileXpert for rapid deployment via extensive
experiments with diverse MS network architecture, CXR imaging quality, and
tuning parameter settings. The source code of cloud and mobile based models are
available from https://github.com/xinli0928/COVID-Xray.

    <title>Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities of Covid-19 attacks rates in
  Suffolk County communities</title>
    <summary>  We investigated the dependence of Covid-19 attack rates on demographic and
socioeconomic factors for the communities in Suffolk County (Long Island, New
York State), presently the 5th most-affected county in the United States.
Confirming the previous observations that minorities are disproportionately
impacted by the Covid-19 disease, we found that the attack rate is strongly
correlated with the minority population proportion, with an alarmingly high
$\sim4$-fold attack rate increase for Black and Hispanic populations.

    <title>SODA: Detecting Covid-19 in Chest X-rays with Semi-supervised Open Set
  Domain Adaptation</title>
    <summary>  The global pandemic of COVID-19 has infected millions of people since its
first outbreak in last December. A key challenge for preventing and controlling
COVID-19 is how to quickly, widely, and effectively implement the test for the
disease, because testing is the first step to break the chains of transmission.
To assist the diagnosis of the disease, radiology imaging is used to complement
the screening process and triage patients into different risk levels. Deep
learning methods have taken a more active role in automatically detecting
COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images, as witnessed in many recent works. Most
of these works first train a CNN on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image
dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much smaller scale.
However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains may lead to
poor performance due to visual domain shift. Also, the small scale of the
COVID-19 dataset on the target domain can make the training fall into the
overfitting trap. To solve all these crucial problems and fully exploit the
available large-scale chest x-ray image dataset, we formulate the problem of
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain
adaptation setting, through which we are motivated to reduce the domain shift
and avoid overfitting when training on a very small dataset of COVID-19. In
addressing this formulated problem, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Open set
Domain Adversarial network (SODA), which is able to align the data
distributions across different domains in a general domain space and also in a
common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a
leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art
models, as well as effectively separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia.

    <title>Artificial Intelligence-based Clinical Decision Support for COVID-19 --
  Where Art Thou?</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 crisis has brought about new clinical questions, new workflows,
and accelerated distributed healthcare needs. While artificial intelligence
(AI)-based clinical decision support seemed to have matured, the application of
AI-based tools for COVID-19 has been limited to date. In this perspective
piece, we identify opportunities and requirements for AI-based clinical
decision support systems and highlight challenges that impact "AI readiness"
for rapidly emergent healthcare challenges.

    <title>Investigating the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India under lockdown</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we investigate the ongoing dynamics of COVID-19 in India after
its emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019. We discuss the effect of
nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the
spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is
used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of
nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its
removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the
peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020.
We also predict a 7$\%$ to 21$\%$ increase in the peak value of active infected
cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation
in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown
period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a
non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to
prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public
health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat,
it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health
and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their
economies.

    <title>Predicting COVID-19 Pneumonia Severity on Chest X-ray with Deep Learning</title>
    <summary>  The need to streamline patient management for COVID-19 has become more
pressing than ever. Chest X-rays provide a non-invasive (potentially bedside)
tool to monitor the progression of the disease. In this study, we present a
severity score prediction model for COVID-19 pneumonia for frontal chest X-ray
images. Such a tool can gauge severity of COVID-19 lung infections (and
pneumonia in general) that can be used for escalation or de-escalation of care
as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU. Images from a
public COVID-19 database were scored retrospectively by three blinded experts
in terms of the extent of lung involvement as well as the degree of opacity. A
neural network model that was pre-trained on large (non-COVID-19) chest X-ray
datasets is used to construct features for COVID-19 images which are predictive
for our task. This study finds that training a regression model on a subset of
the outputs from an this pre-trained chest X-ray model predicts our geographic
extent score (range 0-8) with 1.14 mean absolute error (MAE) and our lung
opacity score (range 0-6) with 0.78 MAE. All code, labels, and data are made
available at https://github.com/mlmed/torchxrayvision and

    <title>Tracking Public Opinion in China through Various Stages of the COVID-19
  Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  In recent months, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and had a huge impact
on the world. People under different conditions have very different attitudes
toward the epidemic. Due to the real-time and large-scale nature of social
media, we can continuously obtain a massive amount of public opinion
information related to the epidemic from social media. In particular,
researchers may ask questions such as "how is the public reacting to COVID-19
in China during different stages of the pandemic?", "what factors affect the
public opinion orientation in China?", and so on. To answer such questions, we
analyze the pandemic related public opinion information on Weibo, China's
largest social media platform. Specifically, we have first collected a large
amount of COVID-19-related public opinion microblogs. We then use a sentiment
classifier to recognize and analyze different groups of users' opinions. In the
collected sentiment orientated microblogs, we try to track the public opinion
through different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we analyze more
key factors that might have an impact on the public opinion of COVID-19 (e.g.,
users in different provinces or users with different education levels).
Empirical results show that the public opinions vary along with the key factors
of COVID-19. Furthermore, we analyze the public attitudes on different
public-concerning topics, such as staying at home and quarantine.

    <title>Joint spatio-temporal analysis of multiple response types using the
  hierarchical generalized transformation model with application to coronavirus
  disease 2019 and social distancing</title>
    <summary>  Social distancing can be described as an effort to maintain a physical
distance between individuals and has become a necessary public health measure
to combat cornoavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Social distancing is known to
weaken incidences and deaths due to COVID-19, however, there are detrimental
economic and psychological effects. This motivates us to analyze incidences
(and deaths) of COVID-19 along with a measure of the health of the US economy
(i.e., the adjusted closing price of the Dow Jones Industrial), and a measure
of the public interest in COVID-19 through Google Trends data. The model we
implement is developed to be easily adapted to a data scientist's preferred
method for continuous data, which is done to aid future analyses of this
important dataset. This dataset consists of multiple response types (e.g.,
continuous-valued, count-valued, binomial counts). Thus, we introduce a
reasonable easy-to-implement all-purpose method that "converts" a statistical
model for continuous responses (the preferred model) into a Bayesian model for
multi-response data sets. To do this, we transform the data such that the
continuous-valued transformed data can be reasonably modeled using the
preferred model and the transformation itself is treated as unknown. The
implementation of our approach involves two steps. The first step produces
posterior replicates of the transformed data using a latent conjugate
multivariate (LCM) model. The second step involves generating values from the
posterior distribution implied by the preferred model. We refer to our model as
the hierarchical generalized transformation (HGT) model. In a simulation, we
demonstrate the flexibility of the HGT model by incorporating two different
preferred models: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and the spatial
mixed effects (spatio-temporal mixed effects) models.

    <title>The D model for deaths by COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We present a simple analytical model to describe the fast increase of deaths
produced by the corona virus (COVID-19) infections. The 'D' (deaths) model
comes from a simplified version of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)
model known as SI model. It assumes that there is no recovery. In that case the
dynamical equations can be solved analytically and the result is extended to
describe the D-function that depends on three parameters that we can fit to the
data. Results for the data from Spain, Italy and China are presented. The model
is validated by comparing with the data of deaths in China, which are well
described. This allows to make predictions for the development of the disease
in Spain and Italy.

    <title>Tracing Contacts to Control the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a considerable reduction of
contacts mostly achieved by imposing movement control up to the level of
enforced quarantine. This has lead to a collapse of substantial parts of the
economy. Carriers of the disease are infectious roughly 3 days after exposure
to the virus. First symptoms occur later or not at all. As a consequence
tracing the contacts of people identified as carriers is essential for
controlling the pandemic. This tracing must work everywhere, in particular
indoors, where people are closest to each other. Furthermore, it should respect
people's privacy. The present paper presents a method to enable a thorough
traceability with very little risk on privacy. In our opinion, the latter
capabilities are necessary to control the pandemic during a future relaunch of
our economy.

    <title>On the problem of comparing Covid-19 fatality rates</title>
    <summary>  Understanding Covid-19 lethality and its variation from country to country is
essential for supporting governments in the choice of appropriate strategies.
Adopting correct indicators to monitor the lethality of the infection in the
course of the outbreak is a crucial issue. This works highlights how far the
time-dependent case fatality rate is a misleading indicator for estimating the
fatality in the course of the outbreak, even if our attention is only
restricted to the subset of confirmed cases. Our analysis proves that the final
case fatality ratio for several major European countries is bound to largely
exceed 10%. The largely discussed difference in the fatality ratio between
Italy and other major European countries, is to be mostly attributed (except
for the case of Germany) to the more advanced stage of the Italian epidemic.

    <title>Inferring the COVID-19 infection curve in Italy</title>
    <summary>  Aim of this manuscript is to show a simple method to infer the time-course of
new COVID-19 infections (the most important information in order to establish
the effect of containment strategies) from available aggregated data, such as
number of deaths and hospitalizations. The method, that was used for HIV-AIDS
and was named `back-calculation', relies on good estimates of the distribution
of the delays between infection and the observed events; assuming that the
epidemic follows a simple SIR model with a known generation interval, we can
then estimate the parameters that define the time-varying contact rate through
maximum likelihood. We show the application of the method to data from Italy
and several of its region; it is found that $R_0$ had decreased consistently
below 1 around March 20, and in the beginning of April it was between 0.5 and
0.8 in the whole Italy and in most regions.

    <title>Automatic Textual Evidence Mining in COVID-19 Literature</title>
    <summary>  We created this EVIDENCEMINER system for automatic textual evidence mining in
COVID-19 literature. EVIDENCEMINER is a web-based system that lets users query
a natural language statement and automatically retrieves textual evidence from
a background corpora for life sciences. It is constructed in a completely
automated way without any human effort for training data annotation.
EVIDENCEMINER is supported by novel data-driven methods for distantly
supervised named entity recognition and open information extraction. The named
entities and meta-patterns are pre-computed and indexed offline to support fast
online evidence retrieval. The annotation results are also highlighted in the
original document for better visualization. EVIDENCEMINER also includes
analytic functionalities such as the most frequent entity and relation
summarization.

    <title>Refined compartmental models, asymptomatic carriers and COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The goal of this article is to analyze some compartmental models specially
designed to model the spread of a disease whose transmission has the same
features as COVID-19. The major contributions of this article are: (1)
Rigorously find sufficient conditions for the outbreak to only have one peak,
i.e. for no second wave of infection to form; (2) Investigate the formation of
other waves of infection when such conditions are not met; (3) Use numerical
simulations to analyze the different roles asymptomatic carriers can have. We
also argue that dividing the population into non-interacting groups leads to an
effective reduction of the transmission rates. As in any compartmental model,
the goal of this article is to provide qualitative understanding rather than
exact quantitative predictions.

    <title>Forecasting hospital demand during COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks</title>
    <summary>  We present a compartmental SEIRD model aimed at forecasting hospital
occupancy in metropolitan areas during the current COVID-19 outbreak. The model
features asymptomatic and symptomatic infections with detailed hospital
dynamics. We model explicitly branching probabilities and non exponential
residence times in each latent and infected compartments. Using both hospital
admittance confirmed cases and deaths we infer the contact rate and the initial
conditions of the dynamical system, considering break points to model lockdown
interventions. Our Bayesian approach allows us to produce timely probabilistic
forecasts of hospital demand. The model has been used by the federal government
of Mexico to assist public policy, and has been applied for the analysis of
more than 70 metropolitan areas and the 32 states in the country.

    <title>Gender Inequality in Research Productivity During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  We study the disproportionate impact of the lockdown as a result of the
COVID-19 outbreak on female and male academics' research productivity in social
science. We collect data from the largest open-access preprint repository for
social science on 41,858 research preprints in 18 disciplines produced by
76,832 authors across 25 countries in a span of two years. We find that during
the 10 weeks after the lockdown in the United States, although the total
research productivity increased by 35%, female academics' productivity dropped
by 13.9% relative to that of male academics. We also show that several
disciplines drive such gender inequality. Finally, we find that this
intensified productivity gap is more pronounced for academics in top-ranked
universities, and the effect exists in six other countries.

    <title>Deep-COVID: Predicting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep
  Transfer Learning</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a major outbreak in more than 150 countries
around the world, having a severe impact on the health and life of many people
globally. One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect
the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting
this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the
fastest way to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific
abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19.
Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to
detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare
a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images
exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified
radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to
train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50,
SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed
chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images,
and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 97\%($\pm$ 5\%),
while having a specificity rate of around 90\%. While the achieved performance
is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19
images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. Besides
sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC), area under the curve (AUC), and confusion matrix of each
model. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are
all made publicly available for research community, here:

    <title>Exploring Automatic Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Crowdsourced Respiratory
  Sound Data</title>
    <summary>  Audio signals generated by the human body (e.g., sighs, breathing, heart,
digestion, vibration sounds) have routinely been used by clinicians as
diagnostic or progression indicators for diseases and disease onset. However,
until recently, such signals were usually collected through manual auscultation
at scheduled visits. Research has now started to use digital technology to
gather bodily sounds (e.g., from digital stethoscopes) for cardiovascular or
respiratory examination, which could then be used for automatic analysis. Some
initial work shows promise in detecting diagnostic signals of COVID-19 from
voice and coughs. In this paper we describe our data analysis over a
large-scale crowdsourced dataset of respiratory sounds collected to aid
diagnosis of COVID-19. We use coughs and breathing to understand how
discernible COVID-19 sounds are from those in asthma or healthy controls. Our
results show that even a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to
classify correctly healthy and COVID-19 sounds. We also show how we distinguish
a user who tested positive for COVID-19 and has a cough from a healthy user
with cough, and users who tested positive for COVID-19 and have a cough from
users with asthma and a cough. Our models achieve an AUC above 70% across all
tasks. Clearly these results are preliminary and only scratch the surface of
the possibilities of the exploitation of this type of data and audio-based
machine learning. This work opens the door to further investigation of how
automatically analysed respiratory patterns could be used as pre-screening
signals to aid COVID-19 diagnosis.

    <title>Scaling features in the spreading of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many data analyses have been done. Some of
them are based on the classical epidemiological approach that assumes an
exponential growth, but a few studies report that a power-law scaling may
provide a better fit to the currently available data. Hereby, we examine the
data in China (01/20/2020--02/24/2020), and indeed find that the growth closely
follows a power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period. The
exponents are $2.48(20)$, $2.21(6)$ and $4.26(12)$ for the number of confirmed
infections, deaths and cured cases, respectively, indicating an underlying
small-world network structure in the pandemic. While no obvious deviations from
the power-law growth can be seen yet for the number of deaths and cured cases,
negative deviations have clearly appeared in the number of infections,
particularly that for the region outside Hubei. This suggests the beginning of
the slowing-down of the virus spreading due to the huge containment effort.
Meanwhile, we find that despite the dramatic difference in magnitudes, the
growth kinetics of the infection number exhibits much similarity for Hubei
province and the region outside Hubei. On this basis, in log-log plot, we
rescale the infection number for the region outside Hubei such that it overlaps
as much as possible with the total infection number in China, from which an
approximate extrapolation yields the maximum of the pandemic around March 3,
2020, with the number of infections about $83,000$. Further, by analyzing the
kinetics of the mortality in log-log scale, we obtains a rough estimate that
near March 3, the death rate of COVID-19 would be about $4.7\%\thicksim 5.0\%$
for Hubei province and $0.7\%\thicksim1.0\%$ for the region outside Hubei. We
emphasize that our predictions may be quantitatively unreliable, since the data
analysis is purely empirical and various assumptions are used.

    <title>COVID-19 in Africa -- outbreak despite interventions?</title>
    <summary>  Few African countries have reported COVID-19 case numbers above $1\,000$ as
of April 18, 2020, with South Africa reporting $3\,034$ cases being hit hardest
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have
already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical
distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced
human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of
such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing
interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities
and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and
socio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to
intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the
COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the
national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial
exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times
of about $2.5$ days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with
doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth
reported for Hubei/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a
computational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay
Municipality (with $1.14$ million inhabitants) hints that keeping current
levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of
insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently
complied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring,
slightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient
compliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions in
South Africa and potentially for large parts of the African continent.

    <title>Why are most COVID-19 infection curves linear?</title>
    <summary>  Many countries have passed their first COVID-19 epidemic peak. Traditional
epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical
interventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new
phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed
cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain
by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until
herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new
cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the
structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate
there exists a critical number of social contacts, $D_c$, below which linear
growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above $D_c$ traditional
epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When
calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission
rate and the number of days being contagious, we find $D_c\sim 7.2$. Assuming
realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown
measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual
infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of
parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one
country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a
severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard
compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The
probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.

    <title>High-sensitivity COVID-19 group testing by digital PCR</title>
    <summary>  Background: Worldwide demand for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is increasing as
more countries are impacted by COVID-19 and as testing remains central to
contain the spread of the disease, both in countries where the disease is
emerging and in countries that are past the first wave but exposed to
re-emergence. Group testing has been proposed as a solution to expand testing
capabilities but sensitivity concerns have limited its impact on the management
of the pandemic. Digital PCR (RT-dPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than
RT-PCR and could help in this context.
  Methods: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on commercially
available system and assay (Naica System from Stilla Technologies) and
investigated the sensitivity of the method in real life conditions of a
university hospital in Paris, France, in May 2020. We tested the protocol in a
direct comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into
groups of 3 sizes for RT-dPCR analysis: 56 groups of 8 samples, 28 groups of 16
samples and 14 groups of 32 samples.
  Results: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25 positive samples. Using
groups of 8, testing by RT-dPCR identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding
to 26 true positive samples including 2 samples not initially detected by
individual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further RT-PCR and RT-dPCR
investigation. For groups of 16, 15 groups tested positive, corresponding to 25
true positive samples identified. 100% concordance is found for groups of 32
but with limited data points.

    <title>COSRE: Community Exposure Risk Estimator for the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Due to the complexities of virus genotypes and the stochastic contacts in
human society, it is a big challenge to estimate the potential risks of getting
exposed to a widely spreading virus. To allow the public to be aware of the
exposure risks in their daily activities, we proposed a birthday-paradox-based
probability model and implement it into a web-based system named COSRE for
estimating community exposure risks of public gathering during a pandemic. The
exposure risk means the probability of people meeting potential COVID hosts in
public places like grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops,
office suits, etc. The model has three inputs: the real-time potential active
patients, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the
room. With COSRE, people can explore the possible impacts of the pandemic by
doing spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., moving through time and testing a
different number of people to see the changes of risks as the pandemic unfolds.
The system has the potential to advance our ability to know the accurate
exposure risks in various communities and allow us to make plans with improved
preparedness and precise responses for the pandemic. We use spatial analysis
tools and drew the county-level exposure risks of the United States from April
1 to May 15. The experiment shows that the estimation model is very promising
to assist people to be more specifically precise about their safety control in
daily routine and social lives and help businesses to dynamically adjust their
COVID-19 policies to accelerate their recovery.

    <title>Comparing and Integrating US COVID-19 Daily Data from Multiple Sources:
  A County-Level Dataset with Local Characteristics</title>
    <summary>  Over the past several months, the outbreak of COVID-19 has been expanding
over the world. A reliable and accurate dataset of the cases is vital for
scientists to conduct related research and for policy-makers to make better
decisions. We collect the COVID-19 daily reported data from four open sources:
the New York Times, the COVID-19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins University,
the COVID Tracking Project at the Atlantic, and the USAFacts, and compare the
similarities and differences among them. In addition, we examine the following
problems which occur frequently: (1) the order dependencies violation, (2) the
delay-reported issue on weekends and/or holidays, and (3) abnormal data point
or data period. We also integrate the COVID-19 reported cases with the
county-level auxiliary information of the local features from official sources,
such as health infrastructure, demographic, socioeconomic, and environment
information, which are important for understanding the spread of the virus.

    <title>A Study of Knowledge Sharing related to Covid-19 Pandemic in Stack
  Overflow</title>
    <summary>  The Covid-19 outbreak, beyond its tragic effects, has changed to an
unprecedented extent almost every aspect of human activity throughout the
world. At the same time, the pandemic has stimulated enormous amount of
research by scientists across various disciplines, seeking to study the
phenomenon itself, its epidemiological characteristics and ways to confront its
consequences. Information Technology, and particularly Data Science, drive
innovation in all related to Covid-19 biomedical fields. Acknowledging that
software developers routinely resort to open question and answer communities
like Stack Overflow to seek advice on solving technical issues, we have
performed an empirical study to investigate the extent, evolution and
characteristics of Covid-19 related posts. In particular, through the study of
464 Stack Overflow questions posted mainly in February and March 2020 and
leveraging the power of text mining, we attempt to shed light into the interest
of developers in Covid-19 related topics and the most popular technological
problems for which the users seek information. The findings reveal that indeed
this global crisis sparked off an intense and increasing activity in Stack
Overflow with most post topics reflecting a strong interest on the analysis of
Covid-19 data, primarily using Python technologies.

    <title>A Smartphone enabled Approach to Manage COVID-19 Lockdown and Economic
  Crisis</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of novel COVID-19 causing an overload in health system and high
mortality rate. The key priority is to contain the epidemic and prevent the
infection rate. In this context, many countries are now in some degree of
lockdown to ensure extreme social distancing of entire population and hence
slowing down the epidemic spread. Further, authorities use case quarantine
strategy and manual second/third contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19
disease. However, manual contact tracing is time consuming and labor-intensive
task which tremendously overload public health systems. In this paper, we
developed a smartphone-based approach to automatically and widely trace the
contacts for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Particularly, contact-tracing approach
creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or
officials of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach is not only providing
awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but
also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID-19 carrier might not recall.
Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for government officials
on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the
economic crisis. The dashboard used to predict the level of lockdown area based
on collected positions and distance measurements of the registered users in the
vicinity. The prediction model uses K-means algorithm as an unsupervised
machine learning technique for lockdown management.

    <title>A demographic scaling model for estimating the total number of COVID-19
  infections</title>
    <summary>  Understanding how widely COVID-19 has spread is critical for examining the
pandemic's progression. Despite efforts to carefully monitor the pandemic, the
number of confirmed cases may underestimate the total number of infections. We
introduce a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections using an
broadly applicable approach that is based on minimal data requirements:
COVID-19 related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As
many countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific IFRs, we scale IFRs
between countries using remaining life expectancy as a marker to account for
differences in age structures, health conditions, and medical services. Across
10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, the number of
infections is estimated to be four [95% prediction interval: 2-11] times higher
than the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The
estimated number of infections is 1.4 million (six times the number of
confirmed cases) for Italy; 3.1 million (2.2 times the number of confirmed
cases) for the U.S.; and 1.8 times the number of confirmed cases for Germany,
where testing has been comparatively extensive. Our prevalence estimates,
however, are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence
studies. We introduce formulas for quantifying the bias that is required in our
data on deaths in order to reproduce estimates published elsewhere. This bias
analysis shows that either COVID-19 deaths are severely underestimated, by a
factor of two or more; or alternatively, the seroprevalence based results are
overestimates and not representative for the total population.

    <title>Stocks Vote with Their Feet: Can a Piece of Paper Document Fights the
  COVID-19 Pandemic?</title>
    <summary>  Assessing the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic and policy effectiveness is
essential for both policymakers and stock investors, but challenging because
the crisis has unfolded with extreme speed and the previous index was not
suitable for measuring policy effectiveness for COVID-19. This paper builds an
index of policy effectiveness on fighting COVID-19 pandemic, whose building
method is similar to the index of Policy Uncertainty, based on province-level
paper documents released in China from Jan.1st to Apr.16th of 2020. This paper
also studies the relationships among COVID-19 daily confirmed cases, stock
market volatility, and document-based policy effectiveness in China. This paper
uses the DCC-GARCH model to fit conditional covariance's change rule of
multi-series. This paper finally tests four hypotheses, about the time-space
difference of policy effectiveness and its overflow effect both on the COVID-19
pandemic and stock market. Through the inner interaction of this triad
structure, we can bring forward more specific and scientific suggestions to
maintain stability in the stock market at such exceptional times.

    <title>Analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic by SIR model and machine learning
  technics for forecasting</title>
    <summary>  This work is a trial in which we propose SIR model and machine learning tools
to analyze the coronavirus pandemic in the real world. Based on the public data
from \cite{datahub}, we estimate main key pandemic parameters and make
predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time for the real world
and specifically for Senegal. The coronavirus disease 2019, by World Health
Organization, rapidly spread out in the whole China and then in the whole
world. Under optimistic estimation, the pandemic in some countries will end
soon, while for most part of countries in the world (US, Italy, etc.), the hit
of anti-pandemic will be no later than the end of April.

    <title>Phylogenetic analyses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 reflected the several routes of introduction to Taiwan, the
  United States, and Japan</title>
    <summary>  Worldwide Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection is disrupting in the economy and anxiety of people. The public
anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare
professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified
people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border
measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome
sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United
States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen
parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found
outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study.
These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures
against this virus.

effects on a subset of the German language: An RSS corpus of German-language
newsfeeds (with freely available untruncated unigram frequency lists), a static
but continuously updated HTML page tracking the diversity of the used
vocabulary and a web application that enables other researchers and the broader
public to explore these effects without any or with little knowledge of corpus
representation/exploration or statistical analyses.

    <title>A simple iterative map forecast of the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  We develop a simple 3-dimensional iterative map model to forecast the global
spread of the coronavirus disease. Our model contains at most two fitting
parameters, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health
organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that
our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data,
which exhibits a cross-over from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down
measures begin to take effect. Before these measures, our model predicts
exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which the world
health organisation provided the first `Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$
day 1). Based on this initial data the disease may be expected to infect
approximately 23% of the global population, i.e. about 1.76 billion people,
taking approximately 83 million lives. Under this scenario, the global number
of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020),
with an estimated 60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures
can be maintained, our model predicts power law growth from day 69 onward. Such
growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue for several decades
before a sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population)
have developed immunity to the disease through being infected. Lock-down
measures appear to be very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak
in the daily number of new cases that would occur in the absence of any
interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread of the
disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth
pattern. As such, the duration and severity of the lock-down measures should be
carefully timed against their potentially devastating impact on the world
economy.

    <title>Data-driven Simulation and Optimization for Covid-19 Exit Strategies</title>
    <summary>  The rapid spread of the Coronavirus SARS-2 is a major challenge that led
almost all governments worldwide to take drastic measures to respond to the
tragedy. Chief among those measures is the massive lockdown of entire countries
and cities, which beyond its global economic impact has created some deep
social and psychological tensions within populations. While the adopted
mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful,
policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the
mitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to
recover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak. Classically, exit
strategies rely on mathematical modeling to predict the effect of public health
interventions. Such models are unfortunately known to be sensitive to some key
parameters, which are usually set based on rules-of-thumb.In this paper, we
propose to augment epidemiological forecasting with actual data-driven models
that will learn to fine-tune predictions for different contexts (e.g., per
country). We have therefore built a pandemic simulation and forecasting toolkit
that combines a deep learning estimation of the epidemiological parameters of
the disease in order to predict the cases and deaths, and a genetic algorithm
component searching for optimal trade-offs/policies between constraints and
objectives set by decision-makers. Replaying pandemic evolution in various
countries, we experimentally show that our approach yields predictions with
much lower error rates than pure epidemiological models in 75% of the cases and
achieves a 95% R2 score when the learning is transferred and tested on unseen
countries. When used for forecasting, this approach provides actionable
insights into the impact of individual measures and strategies.

    <title>Management strategies in a SEIR model of COVID 19 community spread</title>
    <summary>  The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID-19) is an ongoing public health
emergency of international focus. Significant gaps persist in our knowledge of
COVID-19 epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and
management, despite (or possibly because of) the fact that the outbreak is an
unprecedented global threat. On the positive side, enough is currently known
about the epidemic process to permit the construction of mathematical
predictive models. We construct and analyze here one first step: that of
adapting a traditional SEIR epidemic model to the specific dynamic compartments
and epidemic parameters of COVID-19, as it spreads in an age-heterogeneous
community. We analyze the current management strategy of the epidemic course
(travel bans, service closures and interruptions, social distancing). We
generate predictions, and assess the efficiency of these control measures, in
the context in which their sustainability is currently being questioned.

    <title>Forecasting COVID 19 growth in India using
  Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (S.I.R) model</title>
    <summary>  This work covers the analysis of the COVID 19 spread in different countries
and dealing the main feature of COVID 19 growth, which is the spread due to the
social-contact structure, which is governed by the parameter \b{eta}. The
dependency of this parameter \b{eta} on the transmission level in society gives
a sense of the effectiveness of the measures taken for social distancing. A
separate algorithm is hardcoded in python using Scipy which learns the
social-contact structure and gives a suitable value for \b{eta}, which has a
major impact on the outcome of the result. Forecasting for the epidemic spread
in India was done, and it was found that the strictness at which social
distancing in India is done, is insufficient for the growth of COVID 19.

    <title>The Covid19Impact Survey: Assessing the Pulse of the COVID-19 Pandemic
  in Spain via 24 questions</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we describe the results of analyzing a large-scale survey,
called the Covid19Impact survey, to assess citizens feedback on four areas
related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: social contact behavior, financial
impact, working situation and health status. A total of 24 questions cover the
areas of demographics, their home situation, social contact behavior, personal
economic impact, their workplace situation and their health. The survey was
responded to by 156,614 participants between the evening of March 28th and
April 2nd, 2020. Such a large response enables us to gain new insights, as well
as an unprecedented glimpse at respondents personal experiences and concerns
during the current COVID-19 pandemic. From the analysis, we draw several
implications for the design of public policies related to the management of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>The impact of multilateral imported cases of COVID-19 on the epidemic
  control in China</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays, the epidemic of COVID-19 in China is under control. However, the
epidemic are developing rapidly around the world. Due to the normal migration
of population, China is facing high risk from imported cases. The potential
specific medicine and vaccine is still in the process of clinical trials.
Currently, controlling the impact of imported cases is the key to prevent new
outbreak of COVID-19 in China. In this paper, we propose two impulsive systems
to describe the impact of multilateral imported cases of COVID-19. Based on the
published data, we simulate and discussed the epidemic trends under different
control strategies. We compare four different scenarios and show the
corresponding medical burden. The results help to design appropriate control
strategy for imported cases in practice.

    <title>Is the epidemic spread related to GDP? Visualizing the distribution of
  COVID-19 in Chinese Mainland</title>
    <summary>  In December 2019, COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of
China. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to the whole Chinese mainland with the people
during the Chinese Spring Festival Travel Rush. As of 19 February 2020, 74576
confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Chinese Mainland. What kind of
cities have more confirmed cases, and is there any relationship between GDP and
confirmed cases? In this study, we explored the relationship between the
confirmed cases of COVID-19 and GDP at the prefectural-level, found a positive
correlation between them. This finding warns high GDP areas should pay more
prevention and control efforts when an epidemic outbreak, as they have greater
risks than other areas nearby.

    <title>Public Health Policy: COVID-19 Epidemic and SEIR Model with Asymptomatic
  Viral Carriers</title>
    <summary>  We measure the effect of different public health regulations to the spread of
COVID-19, based on a SEIRA model -- a SEIR model including asymptomatic
transmissions. The cumulative confirmed cases and death show nonlinear positive
relationship with the value of asymptomatic rate. Based on this model, we
analyze the inhibit effects to COVID-19 of three types of public health
policies, i.e. isolation of laboratory confirmed cases, general personal
protection and quarantine (lock-down). The simulations conclude that the
isolation display limited effects to the asymptomatic viral carriers. The
general personal protection and quarantine perform similar effects when the
their percentages of participants are same. When the total proportion of
asymptomatic, mild symptomatic and neglected patients is 40%, only depends on
isolation policy may lead to an additional 75% infections, compared with
general personal protection or quarantine with an efficiency 80%. At end, we
provide seven recommendations of public health intervention before and during
an aerial transmitted epidemic (COVID-19).

    <title>Modeling COVID-19 in Cape Verde Islands -- An application of SIR model</title>
    <summary>  The rapid and surprised emergence of COVID-19, having infected three million
and killed two hundred thousand people worldwide in less than five months, has
led many experts to focus on simulating its propagation dynamics in order to
have an estimated outlook for the not too distante future and so supporting the
local and national governments in making decisions. In this paper, we apply the
SIR model to simulating the propagation dynamics of COVID-19 on the Cape Verde
Islands. It will be done firstly for Santiago and Boavista Islands, ant then
for Cape Verde in general. The choice of Santiago rests on the fact that it is
the largest island, with more than 50% of the Population of the country,
whereas Boavista was chosen because it is the island where the first case of
COVID-19 in Cape Verde was diagnosed. Observations made after the date of the
simulations were carried out corroborates our projections.

    <title>Discussion of digital gaming's impact on players' well-being during the
  COVID-19 lockdown</title>
    <summary>  This research discusses how to utilise digital gaming to support the
well-being of its users and sustain their physical and mental health during the
COVID-19 lockdown in which people's activities are limited. The published
academic literature that is written in English and available for access on
online databases was reviewed to develop key take-aways and a framework for
discussing how to enhance people's well-being in the COVID-19 lockdown.
Interaction with other players in virtual communities has been found to have a
positive influence on the mental health of those suffering from a lack of
societal connection. A framework for further research has also been developed
that focuses on the critical situation of the COVID-19 lockdown,as this is an
urgent topic with a huge impact on our health.Some gaming service providers
have been proactive in redesigning game programming to be suitable for the
lockdown situation, and this enables players to enjoy physical activities even
at home.

    <title>Cluster-based dual evolution for multivariate time series: analyzing
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a cluster-based method to analyze the evolution of
multivariate time series and applies this to the COVID-19 pandemic. On each
day, we partition countries into clusters according to both their case and
death counts. The total number of clusters and individual countries' cluster
memberships are algorithmically determined. We study the change in both
quantities over time, demonstrating a close similarity in the evolution of
cases and deaths. The changing number of clusters of the case counts precedes
that of the death counts by 32 days. On the other hand, there is an optimal
offset of 16 days with respect to the greatest consistency between cluster
groupings, determined by a new method of comparing affinity matrices. With this
offset in mind, we identify anomalous countries in the progression from
COVID-19 cases to deaths. This analysis can aid in highlighting the most and
least significant public policies in minimizing a country's COVID-19 mortality
rate.

    <title>Simultaneous estimation of the effective reproducing number and the
  detection rate of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  A major difficulty to estimate $R$ (the effective reproducing number) of
COVID-19 is that most cases of COVID-19 infection are mild or asymptomatic,
therefore true number of infection is difficult to determine. This paper
estimates the daily change of $R$ and the detection rate simultaneously using a
Bayesian model. The analysis using synthesized data shows that our model
correctly estimates $R$ and detects a short-term shock of the detection rate.
Then, we apply our model to data from several countries to evaluate the
effectiveness of public healthcare measures. Our analysis focuses Japan, which
employs a moderate measure to keep "social distance". The result indicates a
downward trend and now $R$ becomes below $1$. Although our analysis is
preliminary, this may suggest that a moderate policy still can prevent epidemic
of COVID-19.

    <title>Spatial analysis and prediction of COVID-19 spread in South Africa after
  lockdown</title>
    <summary>  What is the impact of COVID-19 on South Africa? This paper envisages
assisting researchers and decision-makers in battling the COVID-19 pandemic
focusing on South Africa. This paper focuses on the spread of the disease by
applying heatmap retrieval of hotspot areas and spatial analysis is carried out
using the Moran index. For capturing spatial autocorrelation between the
provinces of South Africa, the adjacent, as well as the geographical distance
measures, are used as a weight matrix for both absolute and relative counts.
Furthermore, generalized logistic growth curve modeling is used for the
prediction of the COVID-19 spread. We expect this data-driven modeling to
provide some insights into hotspot identification and timeous action
controlling the spread of the virus.

    <title>Modeling the Dynamics of the COVID-19 Population in Australia: A
  Probabilistic Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The novel Corona Virus COVID-19 arrived on Australian shores around 25
January 2020. This paper presents a novel method of dynamically modeling and
forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia with a high degree of accuracy
and in a timely manner using limited data; a valuable resource that can be used
to guide government decision-making on societal restrictions on a daily and/or
weekly basis. The "partially-observable stochastic process" used in this study
predicts not only the future actual values with extremely low error, but also
the percentage of unobserved COVID-19 cases in the population. The model can
further assist policy makers to assess the effectiveness of several possible
alternative scenarios in their decision-making processes.

    <title>The BCG vaccine does not protect against COVID-19. Evidence from a
  natural experiment in Sweden</title>
    <summary>  The Bacille Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity
benefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized
that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. 12 randomized controlled
trials are currently underway to test this hypothesis, but their results shall
not be available before at least five months. Instead, this paper uses a
nationwide natural experiment. In April 1975, Sweden discontinued newborns BCG
vaccination. The vaccination rate fell from 92% to 2%. I compare the numbers of
COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations for cohorts born just before and just after
that change. I find no statistically significant differences, and I can reject
small BCG effects. Thus, receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not seem to
have a protective effect against COVID-19.

    <title>Long-Term Care Facilities as a Risk Factor for Death Due to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  A large percentage of the deaths from COVID-19 occur among residents of
long-term care facilities. There are two possible reasons for this phenomenon.
First, the structural features of such settings may lead to death.
Alternatively, it is possible that individuals in these facilities are in
poorer health than those living elsewhere, and that these individuals would
have died even if they had not been in these facilities. Our findings show
that, controlling for the population density and the percentage of older adults
in the population, there is a significant positive association between the
number of long-term care beds per capita and COVID-19 mortality rates. This
finding provides support for the claim that long-term care living arrangements
(of older people) are a significant risk factor for dying from COVID-19.

    <title>The Number of Confirmed Cases of Covid-19 by using Machine Learning:
  Methods and Challenges</title>
    <summary>  Covid-19 is one of the biggest health challenges that the world has ever
faced. Public health policy makers need the reliable prediction of the
confirmed cases in future to plan medical facilities. Machine learning methods
learn from the historical data and make a prediction about the event. Machine
learning methods have been used to predict the number of confirmed cases of
Covid-19. In this paper, we present a detailed review of these research papers.
We present a taxonomy that groups them in four categories. We further present
the challenges in this field. We provide suggestions to the machine learning
practitioners to improve the performance of machine learning methods for the
prediction of confirmed cases of Covid-19.

    <title>AI4COVID-19: AI Enabled Preliminary Diagnosis for COVID-19 from Cough
  Samples via an App</title>
    <summary>  Inability to test at scale has become Achille's heel in humanity's ongoing
war against COVID-19 pandemic. An agile, scalable and cost-effective testing,
deployable at a global scale, can act as a game changer in this war. To address
this challenge, building on the promising results of our prior work on
cough-based diagnosis of a motley of respiratory diseases, we develop an
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based test for COVID-19 preliminary diagnosis. The
test is deployable at scale through a mobile app named AI4COVID-19. The
AI4COVID-19 app requires 2-second cough recordings of the subject. By analyzing
the cough samples through an AI engine running in the cloud, the app returns a
preliminary diagnosis within a minute. Unfortunately, cough is common symptom
of over two dozen non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the
COVID-19 diagnosis from cough alone an extremely challenging problem. We solve
this problem by developing a novel multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse
AI architecture that minimizes misdiagnosis. At the time of writing, our AI
engine can distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of
non-COVID-19 coughs with over 90% accuracy. AI4COVID-19's performance is likely
to improve as more and better data becomes available. This paper presents a
proof of concept to encourage controlled clinical trials and serves as a call
for labeled cough data. AI4COVID-19 is not designed to compete with clinical
testing. Instead, it offers a complementing tele-testing tool deployable
anytime, anywhere, by anyone, so clinical-testing and treatment can be
channeled to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.

    <title>A New Modified Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Detecting COVID-19
  from X-ray Images</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has become a serious health problem all around the world. It is
confirmed that this virus has taken over 126,607 lives until today. Since the
beginning of its spreading, many Artificial Intelligence researchers developed
systems and methods for predicting the virus's behavior or detecting the
infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to
COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large
number of patients in hospitals, it would be time-consuming and difficult to
examine lots of X-ray images, so it can be very useful to develop an AI network
that does this job automatically. In this paper, we have trained several deep
convolutional networks with the introduced training techniques for classifying
X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two
open-source datasets. Unfortunately, most of the previous works on this subject
have not shared their dataset, and we had to deal with few data on covid19
cases. Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected to
COVID-19, so we tried to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In
this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network
learn better when we have few cases of COVID-19, and also we propose a neural
network that is a concatenation of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This
network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by
two robust networks. In this paper, despite some other researches, we have
tested our network on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy our network
can achieve in real circumstances. The average accuracy of the proposed network
for detecting COVID-19 cases is 99.56%, and the overall average accuracy for
all classes is 91.4%.

    <title>Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to Diagnose COVID-19 and other
  Pneumonia Diseases from Posteroanterior Chest X-Rays</title>
    <summary>  The article explores different deep convolutional neural network
architectures trained and tested on posteroanterior chest X-rays of 327
patients who are healthy (152 patients), diagnosed with COVID-19 (125), and
other types of pneumonia (48). In particular, this paper looks at the deep
convolutional neural networks VGG16 and VGG19, InceptionResNetV2 and
InceptionV3, as well as Xception, all followed by a flat multi-layer perceptron
and a final 30% drop-out. The paper has found that the best performing network
is VGG16 with a final $30$% drop-out trained over 3 classes (COVID-19, No
Finding, Other Pneumonia). It has an internal cross-validated accuracy of
$93.9(\pm3.4)$%, a COVID-19 sensitivity of $87.7(-1.9,+2)$%, and a No Finding
sensitivity of $96.8(\pm0.8)$%. The respective external cross-validated values
are $84.1(\pm13.5)$%, $87.7(-1.9,2)$%, and $96.8(\pm0.8)$%. The model optimizer
was Adam with a 1e-4 learning rate, and categorical cross-entropy loss. It is
hoped that, once this research will be put to practice in hospitals, healthcare
professionals will be able in the medium to long-term to diagnosing through
machine learning tools possible pneumonia, and if detected, whether it is
linked to a COVID-19 infection, allowing the detection of new possible COVID-19
foyers after the end of possible "stop-and-go" lockdowns as expected by until a
vaccine is found and widespread. Furthermore, in the short-term, it is hoped
practitioners can compare the diagnosis from the deep convolutional neural
networks with possible RT-PCR testing results, and if clashing, a Computed
Tomography could be performed as they are more accurate in showing COVID-19
pneumonia.

    <title>A simple Stochastic SIR model for COVID 19 Infection Dynamics for
  Karnataka: Learning from Europe</title>
    <summary>  In this short note we model the region-wise trends of the evolution to
COVID-19 infections using a stochastic SIR model. The SIR dynamics are
expressed using \textit{It\^o-stochastic differential equations}. We first
derive the parameters of the model from the available daily data from European
regions based on a 24-day history of infections, recoveries and deaths. The
derived parameters have been aggregated to project future trends for the Indian
subcontinent, which is currently at an early stage in the infection cycle. The
projections are meant to serve as a guideline for strategizing the
socio-political counter measures to mitigate COVID-19.

    <title>Mathematical Modeling of COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics with a Case
  Study of Wuhan</title>
    <summary>  We propose a compartmental mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19
disease with special focus on the transmissibility of super-spreaders
individuals. We compute the basic reproduction number threshold, we study the
local stability of the disease free equilibrium in terms of the basic
reproduction number, and we investigate the sensitivity of the model with
respect to the variation of each one of its parameters. Numerical simulations
show the suitability of the proposed COVID-19 model for the outbreak that
occurred in Wuhan, China.

    <title>Dynamic topic modeling of the COVID-19 Twitter narrative among U.S.
  governors and cabinet executives</title>
    <summary>  A combination of federal and state-level decision making has shaped the
response to COVID-19 in the United States. In this paper we analyze the Twitter
narratives around this decision making by applying a dynamic topic model to
COVID-19 related tweets by U.S. Governors and Presidential cabinet members. We
use a network Hawkes binomial topic model to track evolving sub-topics around
risk, testing and treatment. We also construct influence networks amongst
government officials using Granger causality inferred from the network Hawkes
process.

    <title>Simulations of the spread of COVID-19 and control policies in Tunisia</title>
    <summary>  We develop and analyze in this work an epidemiological model for COVID-19
using Tunisian data. Our aims are first to evaluate Tunisian control policies
for COVID-19 and secondly to understand the effect of different screening,
quarantine and containment strategies and the rule of the asymptomatic patients
on the spread of the virus in the Tunisian population. With this work, we show
that Tunisian control policies are efficient in screening infected and
asymptomatic individuals and that if containment and curfew are maintained the
epidemic will be quickly contained.

    <title>A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for COVID-19 Detection Using Chest
  X-Rays</title>
    <summary>  We present an image classifier based on the CheXNet and a transfer learning
stage to classify chest X-Ray images according to three labels: COVID-19, viral
pneumonia and normal. CheXNet is a DenseNet121 that has been trained twice,
firstly on ImageNet and then, for classification of pneumonia and other 13
chest diseases, over a large chest X-Ray database (ChestX- ray14). The proposed
network reached a test accuracy of 97.8% and, for the COVID-19 class, of 98.3%.
In order to clarify the modus operandi of the network, we used Layer Wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) to generate heat maps, indicating an analytical
path for future research on diagnosis.

    <title>Using statistics and mathematical modelling to understand infectious
  disease outbreaks: COVID-19 as an example</title>
    <summary>  During an infectious disease outbreak, biases in the data and complexities of
the underlying dynamics pose significant challenges in mathematically modelling
the outbreak and designing policy. Motivated by the ongoing response to
COVID-19, we provide a toolkit of statistical and mathematical models beyond
the simple SIR-type differential equation models for analysing the early stages
of an outbreak and assessing interventions. In particular, we focus on
parameter estimation in the presence of known biases in the data, and the
effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in enclosed subpopulations, such as
households and care homes. We illustrate these methods by applying them to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Modelling provincial Covid-19 epidemic data in Italy using an adjusted
  time-dependent SIRD model</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we develop a predictive model for the spread of COVID-19
infection at a provincial (i.e. EU NUTS-3) level in Italy by using official
data from the Italian Ministry of Health integrated with data extracted from
daily official press conferences of regional authorities and from local
newspaper websites. This integration is mainly concerned with COVID-19 cause
specific death data which are not available at NUTS-3 level from open official
data data channels. An adjusted time-dependent SIRD model is used to predict
the behavior of the epidemic, specifically the number of susceptible, infected,
deceased and recovered people. Predictive model performance is evaluated using
comparison with real data.

    <title>Visual Data Analysis and Simulation Prediction for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 (formerly, 2019-nCoV) epidemic has become a global health
emergency, as such, WHO declared PHEIC. China has taken the most hit since the
outbreak of the virus, which could be dated as far back as late November by
some experts. It was not until January 23rd that the Wuhan government finally
recognized the severity of the epidemic and took a drastic measure to curtain
the virus spread by closing down all transportation connecting the outside
world. In this study, we seek to answer a few questions: How did the virus get
spread from the epicenter Wuhan city to the rest of the country? To what extent
did the measures, such as, city closure and community quarantine, help
controlling the situation? More importantly, can we forecast any significant
future development of the event had some of the conditions changed? By
collecting and visualizing publicly available data, we first show patterns and
characteristics of the epidemic development; we then employ a mathematical
model of disease transmission dynamics to evaluate the effectiveness of some
epidemic control measures, and more importantly, to offer a few tips on
preventive measures.

    <title>Calibrated Intervention and Containment of the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has infected more than 823,000 people globally and resulted in over
40,000 deaths as of April 1, 2020. Swift government response to contain the
outbreak requires accurate and continuous census of the infected population,
particularly with regards to viral carriers without severe symptoms. We take on
this task by converting the symptom onset time distribution, which we
calibrated, into the percentage of the latent, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic
groups through a novel mathematical procedure. We then estimate the reduction
of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ under specific disease control practices
such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and staying
at home. When these measures are implemented in parallel, their effects on
$R_0$ multiply. For example, if 70% of the general public wear masks and
contact tracing is conducted at 60% efficiency within a 4-day time frame,
epidemic growth will be flattened in the hardest hit countries. Finally, we
analyze the bell-shaped curves of epidemic evolution from various affected
regions and point out the significance of a universal decay rate of -0.32/day
in the final eradication of the disease.

    <title>Neural network based country wise risk prediction of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The recent worldwide outbreak of the novel corona-virus (COVID-19) opened up
new challenges to the research community. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven
methods can be useful to predict the parameters, risks, and effects of such an
epidemic. Such predictions can be helpful to control and prevent the spread of
such diseases. The main challenges of applying AI is the small volume of data
and the uncertain nature. Here, we propose a shallow Long short-term memory
(LSTM) based neural network to predict the risk category of a country. We have
used a Bayesian optimization framework to optimized and automatically design
country-specific networks. We have combined the trend data and weather data
together for the prediction. The results show that the proposed pipeline
outperforms against state-of-the-art methods for 170 countries data and can be
a useful tool for such risk categorization. The tool can be used to predict
long-duration outbreak of such an epidemic such that we can take preventive
steps earlier.

    <title>Metropolitan-scale COVID-19 outbreaks: how similar are they?</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we use US county-level COVID-19 case data from January
21-March 25, 2020 to study the exponential behavior of case growth at the
metropolitan scale. In particular, we assume that all localized outbreaks are
in an early stage (either undergoing exponential growth in the number of cases,
or are effectively contained) and compare the explanatory performance of
different simple exponential and linear growth models for different
metropolitan areas. While we find no relationship between city size and
exponential growth rate (directly related to $R0$, which denotes average the
number of cases an infected individual infects), we do find that larger cities
seem to begin exponential spreading earlier and are thus in a more advanced
stage of the pandemic at the time of submission. We also use more recent data
to compute prediction errors given our models, and find that in many cities,
exponential growth models trained on data before March 26 are poor predictors
for case numbers in this more recent period (March 26-30), likely indicating a
reduction in the number of new cases facilitated through social distancing.

    <title>Alternating quarantine for sustainable mitigation of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Lacking a drug or vaccine, the current strategy to contain the COVID-19
pandemic is by means of social distancing, specifically mobility restrictions
and lock-downs. Such measures impose a hurtful toll on the economy, and are
difficult to sustain for extended periods. The challenge is that selective
isolation of the symptomatic patients is insufficient to control SARS-CoV-2,
due to its relatively long incubation period, in which individuals experience
no symptoms, but may already contribute to the spread. How then do we isolate
these \textit{invisible} pre-symptomatic spreaders? Here we propose an
alternating quarantine strategy, in which at every instance, half of the
population remains under lock-down while the other half continues to be active,
maintaining a routine of weekly succession between activity and quarantine.
Under this regime, if an individual was exposed during their active week, by
the time they complete their quarantine they will, in most cases, begin to
exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the majority of pre-symptomatic
individuals during their infectious phase, leading to a rapid decline in the
viral spread - all while sustaining a continuously active economy at $50\%$
capacity.

    <title>Common trends in the epidemic of Covid-19 disease</title>
    <summary>  The discovery of SARS-CoV-2, the responsible virus for the Covid-19 epidemic,
has sparked a global health concern with many countries affected. Developing
models that can interpret the epidemic and give common trend parameters are
useful for prediction purposes by other countries that are at an earlier phase
of the epidemic; it is also useful for future planning against viral
respiratory diseases. One model is developed to interpret the fast-growth phase
of the epidemic and another model for an interpretation of the entire data set.
Both models agree reasonably with the data. It is shown by the first model that
during the fast phase, the number of new infected cases depends on the total
number of cases by a power-law relation with a scaling exponent equal to 0.82.
The second model gives a duplication time in the range 1 to 3 days early in the
start of the epidemic, and another parameter alpha = 0.1-0.5) that deviates the
progress of the epidemic from an exponential growth. Our models may be used for
data interpretation and for guiding predictions regarding this disease, e.g.
the onset of the maximum in the number of new cases.

    <title>Impacts of Covid-19 mode shift on road traffic</title>
    <summary>  This article is driven by the following question: as the communities reopen
after the COVID-19 pandemic, will changing transportation mode share lead to
worse traffic than before? This question could be critical especially if many
people rush to single occupancy vehicles. To this end, we estimate how
congestion will increases as the number of cars increase on the road, and
identify the most sensitive cites to drop in transit usage. Travel time and
mode share data from the American Community Survey of the US Census Bureau, for
metro areas across the US. A BPR model is used to relate average travel times
to the estimated number of commuters traveling by car. We then evaluate
increased vehicle volumes on the road if different portions of transit and car
pool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles, and report the resulting travel
time from the BPR model. The scenarios predict that cities with large transit
ridership are at risk for extreme traffic unless transit systems can resume
safe, high throughput operations quickly.

    <title>Characterizing information leaders in Twitter during COVID-19 crisis</title>
    <summary>  Information is key during a crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic as
it greatly shapes people opinion, behaviour and even their psychological state.
It has been acknowledged from the Secretary-General of the United Nations that
the infodemic of misinformation is an important secondary crisis produced by
the pandemic. Infodemics can amplify the real negative consequences of the
pandemic in different dimensions: social, economic and even sanitary. For
instance, infodemics can lead to hatred between population groups that fragment
the society influencing its response or result in negative habits that help the
pandemic propagate. On the contrary, reliable and trustful information along
with messages of hope and solidarity can be used to control the pandemic, build
safety nets and help promote resilience and antifragility. We propose a
framework to characterize leaders in Twitter based on the analysis of the
social graph derived from the activity in this social network. Centrality
metrics are used to identify relevant nodes that are further characterized in
terms of users parameters managed by Twitter. We then assess the resulting
topology of clusters of leaders. Although this tool may be used for

application to empower users with a positive influence in the collective
behaviour of the network and the propagation of information.

    <title>Design of a Self-powered Smart Mask for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Usage of a face mask has become mandatory in many countries after the
outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and its usefulness in combating the pandemic is a
proven fact. There have been many advancements in the design of a face mask and
the present treatise describes a face mask in which a simple textile
triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) serves the purpose of filtration of
SARS-CoV-2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer protection sheets, in
which the first two layers act as triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one
is a smart filter. The conjugated effect of contact electrification, and
electrostatic induction of the proposed smart mask are effective in
inactivating the span of virus-ladden aerosols in a bidirectional way. Five
pairs of triboseries fabrics i.e. nylon - polyester, cotton - polyester,
poly(methyl methacrylate) - PVDF, lylon - PVDF and polypropylene - polyester
have been optimized in this study in terms of their effective tribo-electric
charge densities as 83.13, 211.48, 38.62, 69 and 74.25 nC/m2, respectively.
This smart mask can be used by a wide range of people because of its simple
mechanism, self-driven (harvesting mechanical energy from daily activities,
e.g. breathing, talking, or other facial movements functionalities, and
effective filtration efficiency and thus, it is expected to be potentially
beneficial to slow down the devastating impact of COVID-19.

    <title>Estimating the Number of Infected Cases in COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disturbance to human life. An
important reason behind the widespread social anxiety is the huge uncertainty
about the pandemic. One major uncertainty is how many or what percentage of
people have been infected? There are published and frequently updated data on
various statistics of the pandemic, at local, country or global level. However,
due to various reasons, many cases were not included in those reported numbers.
We propose a structured approach for the estimation of the number of unreported
cases, where we distinguish cases that arrive late in the reported numbers and
those who had mild or no symptoms and thus were not captured by any medical
system at all. We use post-report data for the estimation of the former and
population matching to the latter. We estimate that the reported number of
infected cases in the US should be corrected by multiplying a factor of 220.54%
as of Apr 20, 2020. The infection ratio out of the US population is estimated
to be 0.53%, implying a case mortality rate at 2.85% which is close to the 3.4%
suggested by the WHO.

    <title>Global Short-Term Forecasting of Covid-19 Cases</title>
    <summary>  The continuously growing number of COVID-19 cases pressures healthcare
services worldwide. Accurate short-term forecasting is thus vital to support
country-level policy making. The strategies adopted by countries to combat the
pandemic vary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number
of cases. Accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data and
accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new
modelling framework to describe the course of the pandemic with great accuracy,
and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show
that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to six days ahead, and
use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We
introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive
parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to
adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of
deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and
generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has
strong implications for global planning and decision making. We constantly
update forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the
world through an online Shiny dashboard.

    <title>The Computational Patient has Diabetes and a COVID</title>
    <summary>  Medicine is moving from reacting to a disease to prepare personalised and
precision paths to well being. The complex and multi level pathophysiological
patterns of most diseases require a systemic medicine approach and are
challenging current medical therapies. Computational medicine is a vibrant
interdisciplinary field that could help moving from an organ-centered to a
process-oriented or systemic medicine data analysis. The resulting
Computational patient may require an international interdisciplinary effort,
probably of larger scientific and technological interdisciplinarity than the
human genome sequencing. When deployed, it will have a profound impact on how
healthcare is delivered to patients. Here we present a Computational patient
model that integrates, refine and extend recent specific mechanistic or
phenomenological models of cardiovascular, RAS and diabetic processes. Our aim
is twofold: analyse the modularity and composability of the models-building
blocks of the Computational patient and to study the dynamical properties of
well-being and disease states in a broader functional context. We present
results from a number of experiments among which we characterise the dynamical
impact of covid-19 and T2D diabetes on cardiovascular and inflammation
conditions. We tested these experiments under exercise and meals and drug
regimen. We report results showing the striking importance of transient
dynamical responses to acute state conditions and we provide guidelines for
system design principle of the inter-relationship between modules and
components for systemic medicine. Finally this initial Computational Patient
can be used as a toolbox for further modifications and extensions.

    <title>The hidden side of COVID-19 spread in Italy</title>
    <summary>  Background. The paper concerns the SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic that,
starting from the end of February 2020, began spreading along the Italian
peninsula, by first attacking small communities in north regions, and then
extending to the center and south of Italy, including the two main islands.
  Objective. The creation of a forecast model that manages to alert the
decision-making bodies and, in particular, the healthcare system, to hinder the
emergence of any other pandemic outbreaks, or the arrival of subsequent
pandemic waves.
  Methods. A new mathematical model to describe the pandemic is given. The
model includes the class of undiagnosed infected people, and has a multi-region
extension, to cope with the in-time and in-space heterogeneity of the epidemic.
  Results. We obtain a robust and reliable tool for the forecast of the total
and active cases, which can be also used to simulate different scenarios.
  Conclusions. We are able to address a number of issues, such as assessing the
adoption of the lockdown in Italy, started from 11 March 2020, and how to
employ a rapid screening test campaign for containing the epidemic.

    <title>International students' loneliness, depression and stress levels in
  COVID-19 crisis. The role of social media and the host university</title>
    <summary>  The move to university life is characterized by strong emotions, some of them
negative, such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression. These negative emotions
are strengthened due to the obligatory lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Previous research indicates association among the use of social media,
university satisfaction, and the aforementioned emotions. We report findings
from 248 international undergraduates in The Netherlands, all students at the
International School of Business. Our results indicate strong correlations
between anxiety, loneliness, and COVID-19-related stress with university
satisfaction together with social capital. Keywords: COVID-19; Pandemic;

infection rate changes with the number infected. The final-size equation for
the total number that the epidemic will infect can be derived analytically, as
can the peak infection proportion. This model could assist planners during for

    <title>Classification of COVID-19 in chest X-ray images using DeTraC deep
  convolutional neural network</title>
    <summary>  Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in
the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high availability of large-scale
annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due
to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of
medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to
transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution
by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to
domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt our previously
developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the
classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any
irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using
a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability
of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset
collected from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 95.12%
(with a sensitivity of 97.91%, a specificity of 91.87%, and a precision of
93.36%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from
normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.

    <title>Target-Specific and Selective Drug Design for COVID-19 Using Deep
  Generative Models</title>
    <summary>  The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid therapeutic
development for infectious diseases. To accelerate this process, we present a
deep learning based generative modeling framework, CogMol, to design drug
candidates specific to a given target protein sequence with high off-target
selectivity. We augment this generative framework with an in silico screening
process that accounts for toxicity, to lower the failure rate of the generated
drug candidates in later stages of the drug development pipeline. We apply this
framework to three relevant proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible
for COVID-19, namely non-structural protein 9 (NSP9) replicase, main protease,
and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Docking to the target
proteins demonstrate the potential of these generated molecules as ligands.
Structural similarity analyses further imply novelty of the generated molecules
with respect to the training dataset as well as possible biological association
of a number of generated molecules that might be of relevance to COVID-19
therapeutic design. While the validation of these molecules is underway, we
release ~ 3000 novel COVID-19 drug candidates generated using our framework.

logistics regression curve fitting is presented. This type of curve is used to
study population growth, in this case population of people infected with the
Covid-19 virus; and it can also be used to approximate the survival curve used

    <title>Understanding the Socio-Economic Disruption in the United States during
  COVID-19's Early Days</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we collect and study Twitter communications to understand the
socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in the United States during the early days of
the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that COVID-19 gripped the nation during this
time as is evidenced by the significant number of trending hashtags. With
infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate
and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools, bars, and
restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. The communications reveal
the ensuing panic buying and the unavailability of some essential goods, in
particular toilet paper. We also observe users express their frustration in
their communications as the virus spread continued. We methodically collect a
total of 530,206 tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related
hashtags. We then group the hashtags into six main categories, namely 1)
General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures, 5)
Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, and study the temporal evolution of
tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to
all the hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group. Our preliminary
study presents a succinct and aggregated picture of people's response to the
pandemic and lays the groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic and
behavioral analysis.

    <title>Daily growth rate of scientific production on Covid-19. Analysis in
  databases and open access repositories</title>
    <summary>  The scientific community is facing one of its greatest challenges in solving
a global health problem: COVID-19 pandemic. This situation has generated an
unprecedented volume of publications. What is the volume, in terms of
publications, of research on COVID-19? The general objective of this research
work is to obtain a global vision of the daily growth of scientific production
on COVID-19 in different databases (Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection,
Scopus-Elsevier, Pubmed and eight repositories). In relation to the results
obtained, Dimensions indexes a total of 9435 publications (69% with peer review
and 2677 preprints) well above Scopus (1568) and WoS (718). This is a classic
biliometric phenomenon of exponential growth (R2 = 0.92). The global growth
rate is 500 publications and the production doubles every 15 days. In the case
of Pubmed the weekly growth is around 1000 publications. Of the eight
repositories analysed, Pubmed Central, Medrxiv and SSRN are the leaders.
Despite their enormous contribution, the journals continue to be the core of
scientific communication. Finally, it has been established that three out of
every four publications on the COVID-19 are available in open access. The
information explosion demands a serious and coordinated response from
information professionals, which places us at the centre of the information
pandemic.

    <title>Influence of COVID-19 confinement in students performance in higher
  education</title>
    <summary>  This study explores the effects of COVID-19 confinement in the students
performance in higher education. Using a field experiment of 458 students from
three different subjects in Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain), we study
the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first
group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The
second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is
the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of
the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect
of the COVID-19 confinement on students performance. This effect is also
significative in activities that did not change their format when performed
after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in
subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that
did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students
learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a
continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement
changed students learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving
their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students assessment are
expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in
their learning performance.

    <title>Effects of weather and policy intervention on COVID-19 infection in
  Ghana</title>
    <summary>  Even though laboratory and epidemiological studies have demonstrated the
effects of ambient temperature on the transmission and survival of
coronaviruses, not much has been done on the effects of weather on the spread
of COVID-19. This study investigates the effects of temperature, humidity,
precipitation, wind speed and the specific government policy intervention of
partial lockdown on the new cases of COVID-19 infection in Ghana. Daily data on
confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 21, 2020 were obtained
from the official website of Our World in Data (OWID) dedicated to COVID-19
while satellite climate data for the same period was obtained from the official
website of NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project.
Considering the nature of the data and the objectives of the study, a time
series generalized linear model which allows for regressing on past
observations of the response variable and covariates was used for model
fitting. The results indicate significant effects of maximum temperature,
relative humidity and precipitation in predicting new cases of the disease.
Also, results of the intervention analysis indicate that the null hypothesis of
no significant effect of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown
should be rejected (p-value=0.0164) at a 5\% level of significance. These
findings provide useful insights for policymakers and the public.

    <title>Evaluation of Ultra Low Dose chest CT imaging for Covid 19 diagnosis and
  follow up</title>
    <summary>  Objective: Computed Tomography (CT) has an important role to detect lung
lesion related to Covide 19. The purpose of this work is to obtain diagnostic
findings of Ultra-Low Dose (ULD) chest CT image and compare with routine dose
chest CT. Material and Methods: Patients, suspected of Covid 19 infection, were
scanned successively with routine dose, and ULD, with 98% or 94% dose
reduction, protocols. Axial images of routine and ULD chest CT were evaluated
objectively by two expert radiologists and quantitatively by Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR) and pixel by pixel noise measurement. Results: It was observed that
the ULD and routine dose chest CT images could detect Covid 19 related lung
lesions in patients with PCR positive test. Also, SNR and pixel noise values
were comparable in these protocols. Conclusion: ULD chest CT with 98% dose
reduction can be used in non-pandemic situation as a substitute for chest
radiograph for screening and follow up. Routine chest CT protocol can be
replaced by ULD, with 94% dose reduction, to detect patients suspected with
Covid 19 at an early stage and for its follow up.

    <title>Symptom extraction from the narratives of personal experiences with
  COVID-19 on Reddit</title>
    <summary>  Social media discussion of COVID-19 provides a rich source of information
into how the virus affects people's lives that is qualitatively different from
traditional public health datasets. In particular, when individuals self-report
their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow
for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the
patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand
accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal
struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure
indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to.
Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in
discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14
days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and
sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language
indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around
critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We
identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with
the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results
provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements
other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues
might appear.

    <title>Coswara -- A Database of Breathing, Cough, and Voice Sounds for COVID-19
  Diagnosis</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic presents global challenges transcending boundaries of
country, race, religion, and economy. The current gold standard method for
COVID-19 detection is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and
violates social distancing. Also, as the pandemic is expected to stay for a
while, there is a need for an alternate diagnosis tool which overcomes these
limitations, and is deployable at a large scale. The prominent symptoms of
COVID-19 include cough and breathing difficulties. We foresee that respiratory
sounds, when analyzed using machine learning techniques, can provide useful
insights, enabling the design of a diagnostic tool. Towards this, the paper
presents an early effort in creating (and analyzing) a database, called
Coswara, of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice. The sound
samples are collected via worldwide crowdsourcing using a website application.
The curated dataset is released as open access. As the pandemic is evolving,
the data collection and analysis is a work in progress. We believe that
insights from analysis of Coswara can be effective in enabling sound based
technology solutions for point-of-care diagnosis of respiratory infection, and
in the near future this can help to diagnose COVID-19.

    <title>Ranking the explanatory power of factors associated with worldwide new
  Covid-19 cases</title>
    <summary>  Disease spread is a complex phenomenon requiring an interdisciplinary
approach. Covid-19 exhibited a global spatial spread in a very short time frame
resulting in a global pandemic. Data of new Covid-19 cases per million were
analysed worldwide at the spatial scale of a country and time replicated from
the end of December 2019 to late May 2020. Data driven analysis of
epidemiological, economic, public health, and governmental intervention
variables was performed in order to select the optimal variables in explaining
new Covid-19 cases across all countries in time. Sequentially, hierarchical
variance partitioning of the optimal variables was performed in order to
quantify the independent contribution of each variable in the total variance of
new Covid-19 cases per million. Results indicated that from the variables
available new tests per thousand explained the vast majority of the total
variance in new cases (51.6%) followed by the governmental stringency index
(15.2%). Availability of hospital beds per 100k inhabitants explained 9%
extreme poverty explained 8.8%, hand washing facilities 5.3%, the fraction of
the population aged 65 or older explained 3.9%, and other disease prevalence
(cardiovascular diseases plus diabetes) explained 2.9%. The percentage of
smokers within the population explained 2.6% of the total variance, while
population density explained 0.6%.

    <title>CT-based COVID-19 Triage: Deep Multitask Learning Improves Joint
  Identification and Severity Quantification</title>
    <summary>  The current COVID-19 pandemic overloads healthcare systems, including
radiology departments. Though several deep learning approaches were developed
to assist in CT analysis, nobody considered study triage directly as a computer
science problem. We describe two basic setups: Identification of COVID-19 to
prioritize studies of potentially infected patients to isolate them as early as
possible; Severity quantification to highlight studies of severe patients and
direct them to a hospital or provide emergency medical care. We formalize these
tasks as binary classification and estimation of affected lung percentage.
Though similar problems were well-studied separately, we show that existing
methods provide reasonable quality only for one of these setups. To consolidate
both triage approaches, we employ a multitask learning and propose a
convolutional neural network to combine all available labels within a single
model. We train our model on approximately 2000 publicly available CT studies
and test it with a carefully designed set consisting of 33 COVID patients, 32
healthy patients, and 36 patients with other lung pathologies to emulate a
typical patient flow in an out-patient hospital. The developed model achieved
0.951 ROC AUC for Identification of COVID-19 and 0.98 Spearman Correlation for
Severity quantification. We release all the code and create a public
leaderboard, where other community members can test their models on our
dataset.

    <title>A predictive model for Covid-19 spread applied to six US states</title>
    <summary>  A compartmental epidemic model is proposed to predict the Covid-19 virus
spread. It considers: both detected and undetected infected populations,
medical quarantine and social sequestration, plus possible reinfection. The
coefficients in the model are evaluated by fitting to empirical data for six US
states: California, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York State, Texas, and
Washington State. The evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states:
contact and detection rates remain below 5%; however, variations are larger in
death rate, recovery rate, and stay-at-home effect. The results reveal that
outbreaks may have been well underway in several states before first detected
and that some western states might have seen more than one influx of the
pandemic. For the majority of states the model's effective reproduction number
is slightly above the critical value of one, indicating that Covid-19 will
become endemic, spreading for more than two years. Should stay-at-home orders
be revoked, most states may experience oscillating yearly infections. Even if
additional lockdowns are applied in Texas, and then released according to White
House guidelines of 14 days of decreasing cases, a similar endemic situation
may occur. Additionally, if lockdowns had been instituted one to three weeks
sooner, the number of Covid-19 deaths in New York could have been significantly
reduced, but surprisingly not in Texas.

    <summary>  The exposure and consumption of information during epidemic outbreaks may
alter risk perception, trigger behavioural changes, and ultimately affect the
evolution of the disease. It is thus of the uttermost importance to map
information dissemination by mainstream media outlets and public response.
However, our understanding of this exposure-response dynamic during COVID-19
pandemic is still limited. In this paper, we provide a characterization of
media coverage and online collective attention to COVID-19 pandemic in four
countries: Italy, United Kingdom, United States, and Canada. For this purpose,
we collect an heterogeneous dataset including 227,768 online news articles and
13,448 Youtube videos published by mainstream media, 107,898 users posts and
3,829,309 comments on the social media platform Reddit, and 278,456,892 views
to COVID-19 related Wikipedia pages. Our results show that public attention,
quantified as users activity on Reddit and active searches on Wikipedia pages,
is mainly driven by media coverage and declines rapidly, while news exposure
and COVID-19 incidence remain high. Furthermore, by using an unsupervised,
dynamical topic modeling approach, we show that while the attention dedicated
to different topics by media and online users are in good accordance,
interesting deviations emerge in their temporal patterns. Overall, our findings
offer an additional key to interpret public perception/response to the current
global health emergency and raise questions about the effects of attention
saturation on collective awareness, risk perception and thus on tendencies
towards behavioural changes.

    <title>Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on the Objective and Analysis of
  Oncology Clinical Trials -- Application of the Estimand Framework</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. The impact of
COVID-19 on patient journeys in oncology represents a new risk to
interpretation of trial results and its broad applicability for future clinical
practice. We identify key intercurrent events that may occur due to COVID-19 in
oncology clinical trials with a focus on time-to-event endpoints and discuss
considerations pertaining to the other estimand attributes introduced in the
ICH E9 addendum. We propose strategies to handle COVID-19 related intercurrent
events, depending on their relationship with malignancy and treatment and the
interpretability of data after them. We argue that the clinical trial objective
from a world without COVID-19 pandemic remains valid. The estimand framework
provides a common language to discuss the impact of COVID-19 in a structured
and transparent manner. This demonstrates that the applicability of the
framework may even go beyond what it was initially intended for.

    <title>Modeling and forecasting the COVID-19 temporal spread in Greece: an
  exploratory approach based on complex network defined splines</title>
    <summary>  Within the complex framework of anti-COVID-19 health management, where the
criteria of diagnostic testing, the availability of public-health resources and
services, and the applied anti-COVID-19 policies vary between countries, the
reliability and the accuracy in the modeling of temporal spread can be proven
effective in the worldwide fight against the disease. This paper applies an
exploratory time-series analysis to the evolution of the disease in Greece,
which currently suggests a success story of COVID-19 management. The proposed
method builds on a recent conceptualization of detecting connective communities
in a time-series and develops a novel spline regression model where the knot
vector is determined by the community detection in the complex network.
Overall, the study contributes to the COVID-19 research by proposing a free of
disconnected past-data and reliable framework of forecasting, which can
facilitate decision-making and management of the available health resources.

  COVID-19? Bibliometric analysis of scientific literature</title>
    <summary>  In this article, we conduct data mining to discover the countries,
universities and companies, produced or collaborated the most research on
Covid-19 since the pandemic started. We present some interesting findings, but
despite analysing all available records on COVID-19 from the Web of Science
Core Collection, we failed to reach any significant conclusions on how the
world responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we increased our analysis
to include all available data records on pandemics and epidemics from 1900 to
2020. We discover some interesting results on countries, universities and
companies, that produced collaborated most the most in research on pandemic and
epidemics. Then we compared the results with the analysing on COVID-19 data
records. This has created some interesting findings that are explained and
graphically visualised in the article.

    <title>High Temperature and High Humidity Reduce the Transmission of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  With the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, a question is whether the
coming summer in the northern hemisphere will reduce the transmission intensity
of COVID-19 with increased humidity and temperature. In this paper, we
investigate this problem using the data from the cases with symptom-onset dates
from January 19 to February 10, 2020 for 100 Chinese cities, and cases with
confirmed dates from March 15 to April 25 for 1,005 U.S. counties. Statistical
analysis is performed to assess the relationship between the transmissibility
of COVID-19 and the temperature/humidity, by controlling for various
demographic, socio-economic, geographic, healthcare and policy factors and
correcting for cross-sectional correlation. We find a similar influence of the
temperature and relative humidity on effective reproductive number (R values)
of COVID-19 for both China and the U.S. before lockdown in both countries:
one-degree Celsius increase in temperature reduces R value by about 0.023
(0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311,
-0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one percent relative humidity rise reduces R value
by 0.0078 (0.0076 (95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI
[-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.). If assuming a 30 degree and 25 percent
increase in temperature and relative humidity from winter to summer in the
northern hemisphere, we expect the R values to decline about 0.89 (0.69 by
temperature and 0.20 by humidity). Given the notion that the non-intervened R
values are around 2.5 to 3, only weather factors cannot make the R values below
their critical condition of R&lt;1, under which the epidemic diminishes gradually.
Therefore, public health intervention such as social distancing is crucial to
block the transmission of COVID-19 even in summer.

    <title>COVID-19 identification in chest X-ray images on flat and hierarchical
  classification scenarios</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia and is estimated to have a high
impact on the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for
pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. CXR are
useful in because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread than CT. This study
aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy
lungs using only CXR images. In order to achieve the objectives, we have
proposed a classification schema considering the multi-class and hierarchical
perspectives, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the
natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling
algorithms in order to re-balance the classes distribution. Our classification
schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also
using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion
techniques in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors
and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database,
named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different
pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution
follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than
others. The proposed approach achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a
multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in
the hierarchical classification scenario. As far as we know, we achieved the
best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced
environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel
proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers
the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the
best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.

    <title>POCOVID-Net: Automatic Detection of COVID-19 From a New Lung Ultrasound
  Imaging Dataset (POCUS)</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, there is an
ever more urgent need for cheap, fast and reliable tools that can assist
physicians in diagnosing COVID-19. Medical imaging such as CT can take a key
role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology,
and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were
demonstrated promising performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a
more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19
detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities
around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung
ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of (currently) 1103 images (654 COVID-19,
277 bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos.
While this dataset was assembled from various online sources and is by no means
exhaustive, it was processed specifically to feed deep learning models and is
intended to serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative. Second, we
train a deep convolutional neural network (POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset
and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a majority vote, a video accuracy of 92%
. For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model performs with a sensitivity
of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross
validation. Third, we provide an open-access web service (POCOVIDScreen) that
is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org. The website deploys the predictive
model, allowing to perform predictions on ultrasound lung images. In addition,
it grants medical staff the option to (bulk) upload their own screenings in
order to contribute to the growing public database of pathological lung
ultrasound images.

    <title>CRISP: A Probabilistic Model for Individual-Level COVID-19 Infection
  Risk Estimation Based on Contact Data</title>
    <summary>  We present CRISP (COVID-19 Risk Score Prediction), a probabilistic graphical
model for COVID-19 infection spread through a population based on the SEIR
model where we assume access to (1) mutual contacts between pairs of
individuals across time across various channels (e.g., Bluetooth contact
traces), as well as (2) test outcomes at given times for infection, exposure
and immunity tests. Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state
for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed,
infectious to recovered. We develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer
contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm
uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each
individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection
status of all contacts and test outcome data. Experimental results with
simulated data demonstrate our CRISP model can be parametrized by the
reproduction factor $R_0$ and exhibits population-level infectiousness and
recovery time series similar to those of the classical SEIR model. However, due
to the individual contact data, this model allows fine grained control and
inference for a wide range of COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy
measures. Moreover, the algorithm is able to support efficient testing in a
test-trace-isolate approach to contain COVID-19 infection spread. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first model with efficient inference for COVID-19
infection spread based on individual-level contact data; most epidemic models
are macro-level models that reason over entire populations. The implementation
of CRISP is available in Python and C++ at
https://github.com/zalandoresearch/CRISP.

    <title>Crisis-Critical Intellectual Property: Findings from the COVID-19
  Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Within national and international innovation systems a pandemic calls for
large-scale action by many actors across sectors, to mobilise resources,
developing and manufacturing Crisis-Critical Products (CC-Products) efficiently
and in the huge quantities needed. Nowadays, this also includes digital
innovations from complex epidemiological models, AI, to open data platforms for
prevention, diagnostic and treatment. Amongst the many challenges during a
pandemic, innovation and manufacturing stakeholders find themselves engaged in
new relationships, and are likely to face intellectual property (IP) related
challenges. This paper adopts an IP perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic to
identify pandemic related IP considerations and IP challenges. The focus is on
challenges related to research, development and urgent upscaling of capacity to
manufacture CC-Products in the huge volumes suddenly in demand. Its purpose is
to provide a structure for steering clear of IP challenges to avoid delays in
fighting a pandemic. We identify 4 stakeholder groups concerned with IP
challenges: (i) governments, (ii) organisations owning existing Crisis-Critical
IP, described as incumbents in Crisis-Critical Sectors (CC-Sectors), (iii)
manufacturing firms from other sectors normally not producing CC-Products
suddenly rushing into CC-Sectors to support the manufacturing of CC-Products
(new entrants), and (iv) voluntary grassroot initiatives that are formed during
a pandemic. This paper discusses IP challenges related to the development and
manufacturing of technologies and products for (i) prevention (of spread), (ii)
diagnosis of infected patients and (iii) the development of treatments. We
offer an initial discussion of potential response measures to reduce IP
associated risks among industrial stakeholders during a pandemic.

    <title>Managing COVID-19 Pandemic without Destructing the Economy</title>
    <summary>  We analyze an approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic without shutting
down the economy while staying within the capacity of the healthcare system. We
base our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which
takes into account different population groups and phases of the disease,
including incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the
intensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number
of hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model
parameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high- and
low-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care
hospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that
countries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid
lockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds
per million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total
number of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to
specific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case
of an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback
loop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the
death curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full- and partial-quarantine
scenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the
whole economy. We conclude that only a limited-time quarantine of the high-risk
group might be necessary, while the rest of the economy can remain operational.

    <title>Forecasting Covid-19 dynamics in Brazil: a data driven approach</title>
    <summary>  This paper has a twofold contribution. The first is a data driven approach
for predicting the Covid 19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced
countries. The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this
approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting
preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM SAE network, which are
somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial
clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the
pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered
features representing a country response to the early spread of the pandemic. A
Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to
predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to
estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve
fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution
that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks
of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil,
with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the
19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected
Brazilians, distributed among the different states, with S\~ao Paulo leading
with almost 65 thousands estimated, confirmed cases. The estimated end of the
pandemics (with 97 percent of cases reaching an outcome) starts as of May 28th
for some states and rests through August 14th, 2020.

    <title>Effective lockdown and role of hospital-based COVID-19 transmission in
  some Indian states: An outbreak risk analysis</title>
    <summary>  There are several reports in India that indicate hospitals and quarantined
centers are COVID-19 hotspots. In the absence of efficient contact tracing
tools, Govt. and the policymakers may not be paying attention to the risk of
hospital-based transmission. To explore more on this important route and its
possible impact on lockdown effect, we developed a mechanistic model with
hospital-based transmission. Using daily notified COVID-19 cases from six
states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Uttar
Pradesh) and overall India, we estimated several important parameters of the
model. Moreover, we provided an estimation of the basic ($R_{0}$), the
community ($R_{C}$), and the hospital ($R_{H}$) reproduction numbers for those
seven locations. To obtain a reliable forecast of future COVID-19 cases, a BMA
post-processing technique is used to ensemble the mechanistic model with a
hybrid statistical model. Using the ensemble model, we forecast COVID-19
notified cases (daily and cumulative) from May 3, 2020, till May 20, 2020,
under five different lockdown scenarios in the mentioned locations. Our
analysis of the mechanistic model suggests that most of the new COVID-19 cases
are currently undetected in the mentioned seven locations. Furthermore, a
global sensitivity analysis of four epidemiologically measurable \&amp;
controllable parameters on $R_{0}$ and as well on the lockdown effect, indicate
that if appropriate preventive measures are not taken immediately, a much
larger COVID-19 outbreak may trigger from hospitals and quarantined centers. In
most of the locations, our ensemble model forecast indicates a substantial
percentage of increase in the COVID-19 notified cases in the coming weeks in
India. Based on our results, we proposed a containment policy that may reduce
the threat of a larger COVID-19 outbreak in the coming days.

    <title>Excess registered deaths in England and Wales during the COVID-19
  pandemic, March 2020 to May 2020</title>
    <summary>  Official counts of COVID-19 deaths have been criticized for potentially
including people who did not die of COVID-19 but merely died with COVID-19. I
address that critique by fitting a generalized additive model to weekly counts
of all deaths registered in England and Wales during the 2010s. The model
produces baseline rates of death registrations expected without the COVID-19
pandemic, and comparing those baselines to recent counts of registered deaths
exposes the emergence of excess deaths late in March 2020. By April's end,
England and Wales registered 45,300 $\pm$ 3200 excess deaths of adults aged
45+. Through 22 May, the last day of available all-deaths data, 56,600 $\pm$
4400 were registered (about 53% of which were of men). Both the ONS's
corresponding count of 43,205 death certificates which mention COVID-19, and
the Department of Health and Social Care's count of 33,671 deaths, are
appreciably less, implying that their counting methods have underestimated, not
overestimated, the pandemic's true death toll. If underreporting rates have
held steady during May, about 59,000 direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths might
have been registered through the end of May but not yet publicly reported in
full.

    <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics in demography-sensitive disease transmission:
  COVID-19 spread in NY as a case study</title>
    <summary>  The rapid transmission of the highly contagious novel coronavirus has been
represented through several data-guided approaches across targeted geographies,
in an attempt to understand when the pandemic will be under control and imposed
lockdown measures can be relaxed. However, these epidemiological models
predominantly based on training data employing number of cases and fatalities
are limited in that they do not account for the spatiotemporal population
dynamics that principally contributes to the disease spread. Here, a stochastic
cellular automata enabled predictive model is presented that is able to
accurate describe the effect of demography-dependent population dynamics on
disease transmission. Using the spread of coronavirus in the state of New York
as a case study, results from the computational framework remarkably agree with
the actual count for infected cases and deaths as reported across
organizations. The predictions suggest that an extended lockdown in some form,
for up to 180 days, can significantly reduce the risk of a second wave of the
outbreak. In addition, increased availability of medical testing is able to
reduce the number of infected patients, even when less stringent social
distancing guidelines and imposed. Equipping this stochastic approach with
demographic factors such as age ratio, pre-existing health conditions,
robustifies the model to predict the transmittivity of future outbreaks before
they transform into an epidemic.

    <title>Assessment of 21 Days Lockdown Effect in Some States and Overall India:
  A Predictive Mathematical Study on COVID-19 Outbreak</title>
    <summary>  As of April, 6th, 2020, the total number of COVID-19 reported cases and
deaths are 4778 and 136. This is an alarming situation as with a huge
population within few days India will enter in stage-3 of COVID-19
transmission. In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and
with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, predictive
mathematical models can help exploring of both COVID-19 transmission and
control. In this present study, we consider a new mathematical model on
COVID-19 transmission that incorporate lock-down effect and variability in
transmission between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations with former being
a fast spreader of the disease. Using daily COVID-19 notified cases from three
states (Maharashtra, Delhi, and Telangana) and overall India, we assess the
effect of current 21 days lock-down in terms of reduction cases and deaths.
Lock-down effect is studied with different lock-down success rate. Our result
suggest that 21 days lock-down will have no impact in Maharashtra and overall
India. Furthermore, the presence of a higher percentage of COVID-19
super-spreaders will further deteriorate the situation in Maharashtra. However,
for Tamil Nadu and Delhi there is some ray of hope as our prediction shows that
lock-down will reduce a significant number of cases and deaths. in these two
locations. Further extension of lock-down may place Delhi and Tamil Nadu in a
comfort zone. Comparing estimated parameter samples for the mentioned four
locations, we find a correlation between effect of lockdown and percentage of
symptomatic infected in a region. Our result suggests that a higher percentage
of symptomatic infected in a region leads to a large number of reduction in
notified cases and deaths due to different lock-down scenario. Finally, we
suggest a policy for the Indian Govt to control COVID-19 outbreak.

    <title>Mood of India During Covid-19 -- An Interactive Web Portal Based on
  Emotion Analysis of Twitter Data</title>
    <summary>  The severe outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic has affected many countries across
the world, and disrupted the day to day activities of many people. During such
outbreaks, understanding the emotional state of citizens of a country could be
of interest to various organizations to carry out tasks and to take necessary
measures. Several studies have been performed on data available on various
social media platforms and websites to understand the emotions of people
against many events, inclusive of Covid-19, across the world. Twitter and other
social media platforms have been bridging the gap between the citizens and
government in various countries and are of more prominence in India. Sentiment
Analysis of posts on twitter is observed to accurately reveal the sentiments.
Analysing real time posts on twitter in India during Covid-19, could help in
identifying the mood of the nation. However, most of the existing studies
related to Covid-19, on twitter and other social media platforms are performed
on data posted during a specific interval. We are not aware of any research
that identifies emotional state of India on a daily basis. Hence, we present a
web portal that aims to display mood of India during Covid-19, based on real
time twitter data. This portal also enables users to select date range,
specific date and state in India to display mood of people belonging to the
specified region, on the specified date or during the specified date range.
Also, the number of Covid-19 cases and mood of people at specific cities and
states on specific dates is visualized on the country map. As of May 6 2020,
the web portal has about 194370 tweets, and each of these tweets are classified
into seven categories that include six basic emotions and a neutral category. A
list of Trigger Events are also specified, to allow users to view the mood of
India on specific events happening in the country during Covid-19.

    <title>Preliminary analysis of COVID-19 spread in Italy with an adaptive SEIRD
  model</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead
(SEIRD) differential model for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread
in some regions of Italy, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile
from February 24th 2020. In this study investigate an adaptation of the model.
Since several restricting measures have been imposed by the Italian government
at different times, starting from March 8th 2020, we propose a modification of
SEIRD by introducing a time dependent transmitting rate. In the numerical
results we report the maximum infection spread for the three Italian regions
firstly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak(Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia
Romagna). This approach will be successively extended to other Italian regions,
as soon as more data will be available.

    <title>Modelling transmission and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia</title>
    <summary>  We develop an agent-based model for a fine-grained computational simulation
of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. This model is calibrated to
reproduce key characteristics of COVID-19 transmission. An important
calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with
this fraction for children found to be one-fifth of such fraction for adults.
We apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including
restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, home quarantine,
social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures.
School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits, unless coupled with
high level of social distancing compliance. We report several trade-offs, and
an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in
the range between 70% and 80% levels, with compliance at the 90% level found to
control the disease within 13--14 weeks, when coupled with effective case
isolation and international travel restrictions.

    <title>Inferring change points in the COVID-19 spreading reveals the
  effectiveness of interventions</title>
    <summary>  As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the globe, short-term modeling
forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and
mitigation strategies. A main challenge for short-term forecasts is the
assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first
interventions show an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model
with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth
rate of new infections. Focusing on the COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detect
change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times
of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can quantify the effect of
interventions, and we can incorporate the corresponding change points into
forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers. Our code is freely available
and can be readily adapted to any country or region.

    <title>Estimation of population infected by Covid-19 using regression
  Generalized logistics and optimization heuristics</title>
    <summary>  In this work, a proposal for the estimation of the populations using logistic
curve fitting is presented. This type of curve is used to study population
growth, in this case population of people infected with the Covid-19 virus; and
it can also be used to approximate the survival curve used in actuarial and
similar studies in Spanish: En este trabajos se presenta una propuesta para la
estimaci\'on de la poblaciones usando ajuste de curvas del tipo log\'istica.
Este tipo de curvas se utilizan para el estudio de crecimiento de poblaciones,
en este casos poblaci\'on de personas infectadas por el virus Covid-19; y
tambi\'en se puede utilizar para aproximar la curva de supervivencia que se
utiliza en estudios actuariales y otras similares

    <title>Analyzing the World-Wide Impact of Public Health Interventions on the
  Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We analyze changes in the reproduction number, R, of COVID-19 in response to
public health interventions. Our results indicate that public health measures
undertaken in China reduced R from 1.5 in January to 0.4 in mid-March 2020.
They also suggest, however, the limitations of isolation, quarantine, and
large-scale attempts to limit travel. While the world-wide reproduction number
briefly dropped below 1 as China implemented extensive public health measures,
the introduction of the virus to other nations swiftly led to an increasing
world-wide average value of R. In Italy, the nation hardest-hit following
China, social distancing measures brought the local value of R down from 3.71
to 2.51. Nonetheless, the value of R in Italy persisted at levels well above 1,
allowing for ongoing transmission. By mid-March 2020, as COVID-19 spread in
areas without extensive public health interventions in place, the world-wide
value of R increased to a level similar to that of late January.

    <title>Estimating the number of COVID-19 infections in Indian hot-spots using
  fatality data</title>
    <summary>  In India the COVID-19 infected population has not yet been accurately
established. As always in the early stages of any epidemic, the need to test
serious cases first has meant that the population with asymptomatic or mild
sub-clinical symptoms has not yet been analyzed. Using counts of fatalities,
and previously estimated parameters for the progress of the disease, we give
statistical estimates of the infected population. The doubling time is a
crucial unknown input parameter which affects these estimates, and may differ
strongly from one geographical location to another. We suggest a method for
estimating epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 in different locations
within a few days, so adding to the information required for gauging the
success of public health interventions

    <title>Scenario analysis of non-pharmaceutical interventions on global COVID-19
  transmissions</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces a dynamic panel SIR (DP-SIR) model to investigate the
impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the COVID-19 transmission
dynamics with panel data from 9 countries across the globe. By constructing
scenarios with different combinations of NPIs, our empirical findings suggest
that countries may avoid the lockdown policy with imposing school closure, mask
wearing and centralized quarantine to reach similar outcomes on controlling the
COVID-19 infection. Our results also suggest that, as of April 4th, 2020,
certain countries such as the U.S. and Singapore may require additional
measures of NPIs in order to control disease transmissions more effectively,
while other countries may cautiously consider to gradually lift some NPIs to
mitigate the costs to the overall economy.

    <title>ArCOV-19: The First Arabic COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Propagation
  Networks</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present ArCOV-19, an Arabic COVID-19 Twitter dataset that
covers the period from 27th of January till 31st of March 2020. ArCOV-19 is the
first publicly-available Arabic Twitter dataset covering COVID-19 pandemic that
includes around 748k popular tweets (according to Twitter search criterion)
alongside the propagation networks of the most-popular subset of them. The
propagation networks include both retweets and conversational threads (i.e.,
threads of replies). ArCOV-19 is designed to enable research under several
domains including natural language processing, information retrieval, and
social computing, among others. Preliminary analysis shows that ArCOV-19
captures rising discussions associated with the first reported cases of the
disease as they appeared in the Arab world. In addition to the source tweets
and the propagation networks, we also release the search queries and the
language-independent crawler used to collect the tweets to encourage the
curation of similar datasets.

    <title>"Stay Nearby or Get Checked": A Covid-19 Lockdown Exit Strategy</title>
    <summary>  This paper repurposes the classic insight from network theory that
long-distance connections drive disease propagation into a strategy for
controlling a second wave of Covid-19. We simulate a scenario in which a
lockdown is first imposed on a population and then partly lifted while
long-range transmission is kept at a minimum. Simulated spreading patterns
resemble contemporary distributions of Covid-19 across nations, regions, and
provinces, providing some model validation. Results suggest that the proposed
strategy may significantly flatten a second wave. We also find that
post-lockdown flare-ups remain local longer, aiding geographical containment.
Public policy may target long ties by heavily focusing medical testing and
mobility tracking efforts on traffic and transport. This policy can be
communicated to the general public as a simple and reasonable principle: Stay
nearby or get checked.

    <title>Women worry about family, men about the economy: Gender differences in
  emotional responses to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Among the critical challenges around the COVID-19 pandemic is dealing with
potentially detrimental effects on people's mental health. Designing
appropriate interventions and identifying the concerns of those most at risk
requires methods that can extract worries, concerns and emotional responses
from text data. We examine gender differences and the effect of document length
on worries about the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Our findings suggest that i)
shorter texts do not offer an as adequate insight into psychological processes
as longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics
concerning emotional responses. Women worried more about their loved ones and
severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy
and society. The findings align with general gender differences in language
found elsewhere, but the current unique circumstances likely amplified these
effects. We close this paper with a call for more high-quality datasets due to
the limitations of Tweet-sized data.

    <title>Data-driven modeling reveals a universal dynamic underlying the COVID-19
  pandemic under social distancing</title>
    <summary>  We show that the COVID-19 pandemic under social distancing exhibits universal
dynamics. The cumulative numbers of both infections and deaths quickly cross
over from exponential growth at early times to a longer period of power law
growth, before eventually slowing. In agreement with a recent statistical
forecasting model by the IHME, we show that this dynamics is well described by
the erf function. Using this functional form, we perform a data collapse across
countries and US states with very different population characteristics and
social distancing policies, confirming the universal behavior of the COVID-19
outbreak. We show that the predictive power of statistical models is limited
until a few days before curves flatten, forecast deaths and infections assuming
current policies continue and compare our predictions to the IHME models. We
present simulations showing this universal dynamics is consistent with disease
transmission on scale-free networks and random networks with non-Markovian
transmission dynamics.

    <title>Target specific mining of COVID-19 scholarly articles using one-class
  approach</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, several research articles have been published in the field
of corona-virus caused diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19. In the presence of
numerous research articles, extracting best-suited articles is time-consuming
and manually impractical. The objective of this paper is to extract the
activity and trends of corona-virus related research articles using machine
learning approaches. The COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) is used for
experiments, whereas several target-tasks along with explanations are defined
for classification, based on domain knowledge. Clustering techniques are used
to create the different clusters of available articles, and later the task
assignment is performed using parallel one-class support vector machines
(OCSVMs). Experiments with original and reduced features validate the
performance of the approach. It is evident that the k-means clustering
algorithm, followed by parallel OCSVMs, outperforms other methods for both
original and reduced feature space.

    <title>Analyzing COVID-19 pandemic with a new growth model for population
  ecology</title>
    <summary>  We have proposed a new form of growth rate for population ecology. Generally,
the growth rate is dependent on the size of the population at that particular
epoch. We have introduced an alternative time-dependent form of growth rate.
This form satisfies essential conditions to represent population growth and can
be an alternative form for growth models to analyze population dynamics. We
have employed the generalized Richards model as a guideline to compare our
results. Further, we have applied our model in the case of epidemics. To check
the efficacy of our model, we have verified the 2003 SARS data. This model has
estimated the final epidemic size with good accuracy. Thereafter, we intend to
describe the present COVID-2019 pandemic. We have performed our analysis with
data for Italy, Spain, and Germany. Following, we have tried to predict the
number of COVID-19 cases and the turning point for the USA, UK, and India.

    <title>A multi-group SEIRA model for the spread of COVID-19 among heterogeneous
  populations</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak and propagation of COVID-19 have posed a considerable challenge
to modern society. In particular, the different restrictive actions taken by
governments to prevent the spread of the virus have changed the way humans
interact and conceive interaction. Due to geographical, behavioral, or economic
factors, different sub-groups among a population are more (or less) likely to
interact, and thus to spread/acquire the virus. In this work, we present a
general multi-group SEIRA model for representing the spread of COVID-19 among a
heterogeneous population and test it in a numerical case of study. By
highlighting its applicability and the ease with which its general formulation
can be adapted to particular studies, we expect our model to lead us to a
better understanding of the evolution of this pandemic and to better
public-health policies to control it.

    <title>Containment effort reduction and regrowth patterns of the Covid-19
  spreading</title>
    <summary>  In all Countries the political decisions aim at the Covid-19 spreading
reduction and at reaching an almost stable configuration of coexistence with
the disease, where a small number of new infected individuals per day is
sustainable. In such a phase, the containment effort will be reduced in favor
of a gradual reopening of the social life and of the various economical sectors
and the evaluation of the possible infection regrowth should be very useful.
Microscopic models, which take into account the details of the new social and
economical conditions, would require a complex dynamics of the stakeholders. We
discuss a less detailed approach which, on the basis of the collected data
after few days from the beginning of the new phase, outlines different
scenarios of the Covid-19 diffusion for longer time. The method applies a time
dependent carrying capacity, analogously to many macroscopic growth laws in
biology, economics and population dynamics. The illustrative cases of
Singapore, Italy and Sicily are analyzed.

    <title>Quantifying Projected Impact of Social Distancing Policies on COVID-19
  Outcomes in the US</title>
    <summary>  Current social distancing measures to impede COVID-19 (such as
shelter-in-place) are economically unsustainable in the long term. Models are
needed to understand the implications of possible relaxation options for these
measures. We report such models, together with corresponding parameter
estimation techniques and prediction outcomes, borrowing insights from another
domain; namely, information cascades. Our models assume that the containment of
the virus into isolated locales is no longer possible. Instead, we explore
options that reduce the rate of spread. We predict COVID-19 contagion trends in
different geographic regions under a "what if" scenario to understand the
effects of potential policy decisions on regional trends. Our model allows
experimentation with other policies that, we hope, can contribute to socially
viable outcomes both in terms of health system capacity and economic impact. We
apply our model to over 30 highly impacted states in the US and publish the
results at https://covid19predictions.csl.illinois.edu/

    <title>Facilitating Access to Multilingual COVID-19 Information via Neural
  Machine Translation</title>
    <summary>  Every day, more people are becoming infected and dying from exposure to
COVID-19. Some countries in Europe like Spain, France, the UK and Italy have
suffered particularly badly from the virus. Others such as Germany appear to
have coped extremely well. Both health professionals and the general public are
keen to receive up-to-date information on the effects of the virus, as well as
treatments that have proven to be effective. In cases where language is a
barrier to access of pertinent information, machine translation (MT) may help
people assimilate information published in different languages. Our MT systems
trained on COVID-19 data are freely available for anyone to use to help
translate information published in German, French, Italian, Spanish into
English, as well as the reverse direction.

    <title>Enhancing Covid-19 Decision-Making by Creating an Assurance Case for
  Simulation Models</title>
    <summary>  Simulation models have been informing the COVID-19 policy-making process.
These models, therefore, have significant influence on risk of societal harms.
But how clearly are the underlying modelling assumptions and limitations
communicated so that decision-makers can readily understand them? When making
claims about risk in safety-critical systems, it is common practice to produce
an assurance case, which is a structured argument supported by evidence with
the aim to assess how confident we should be in our risk-based decisions. We
argue that any COVID-19 simulation model that is used to guide critical policy
decisions would benefit from being supported with such a case to explain how,
and to what extent, the evidence from the simulation can be relied on to
substantiate policy conclusions. This would enable a critical review of the
implicit assumptions and inherent uncertainty in modelling, and would give the
overall decision-making process greater transparency and accountability.

    <title>Analysis of misinformation during the COVID-19 outbreak in China:
  cultural, social and political entanglements</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 resulted in an infodemic, which could erode public trust, impede
virus containment, and outlive the pandemic itself. The evolving and fragmented
media landscape is a key driver of the spread of misinformation. Using
misinformation identified by the fact-checking platform by Tencent and posts on
Weibo, our results showed that the evolution of misinformation follows an
issue-attention cycle, pertaining to topics such as city lockdown, cures, and
preventions, and school reopening. Sources of authority weigh in on these
topics, but their influence is complicated by peoples' pre-existing beliefs and
cultural practices. Finally, social media has a complicated relationship with
established or legacy media systems. Sometimes they reinforce each other, but
in general, social media may have a topic cycle of its own making. Our findings
shed light on the distinct characteristics of misinformation during the
COVID-19 and offer insights into combating misinformation in China and across
the world at large.

    <title>An ensemble approach to short-term forecast of COVID-19 intensive care
  occupancy in Italian Regions</title>
    <summary>  The availability of intensive care beds during the Covid-19 epidemic is
crucial to guarantee the best possible treatment to severely affected patients.
In this work we show a simple strategy for short-term prediction of Covid-19
ICU beds, that has proved very effective during the Italian outbreak in
February to May 2020. Our approach is based on an optimal ensemble of two
simple methods: a generalized linear mixed regression model which pools
information over different areas, and an area-specific non-stationary integer
autoregressive methodology. Optimal weights are estimated using a
leave-last-out rationale. The approach has been set up and validated during the
epidemic in Italy. A report of its performance for predicting ICU occupancy at
Regional level is included.

    <title>What Are People Asking About COVID-19? A Question Classification Dataset</title>
    <summary>  We present COVID-Q, a set of 1,690 questions about COVID-19 from 13 sources,
which we annotate into 15 question categories and 207 question classes. The
most common questions in our dataset asked about transmission, prevention, and
societal effects of COVID, and we found that many questions that appeared in
multiple sources were not answered by any FAQ websites of reputable
organizations such as the CDC and FDA. We post our dataset publicly at
https://github.com/JerryWei03/COVID-Q . For classifying questions into 15
categories, a BERT baseline scored 58.1% accuracy when trained on 20 examples
per class, and for classifying questions into 89 question classes, the baseline
achieved 54.6% accuracy. We hope COVID-Q can be helpful either for direct use
in developing applied systems or as a domain-specific resource for model
evaluation.

    <title>Independent Component Analysis for Trustworthy Cyberspace during High
  Impact Events: An Application to Covid-19</title>
    <summary>  Social media has become an important communication channel during high impact
events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. As misinformation in social media can
rapidly spread, creating social unrest, curtailing the spread of misinformation
during such events is a significant data challenge. While recent solutions that
are based on machine learning have shown promise for the detection of
misinformation, most widely used methods include approaches that rely on either
handcrafted features that cannot be optimal for all scenarios, or those that
are based on deep learning where the interpretation of the prediction results
is not directly accessible. In this work, we propose a data-driven solution
that is based on the ICA model, such that knowledge discovery and detection of
misinformation are achieved jointly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method and compare its performance with deep learning methods, we developed a
labeled COVID-19 Twitter dataset based on socio-linguistic criteria.

    <title>A Comparative Study on Early Detection of COVID-19 from Chest X-Ray
  Images</title>
    <summary>  In this study, our first aim is to evaluate the ability of recent
state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques to early detect COVID-19 from
plain chest X-ray images. Both compact classifiers and deep learning approaches
are considered in this study. Furthermore, we propose a recent compact
classifier, Convolutional Support Estimator Network (CSEN) approach for this
purpose since it is well-suited for a scarce-data classification task. Finally,
this study introduces a new benchmark dataset called Early-QaTa-COV19, which
consists of 175 early-stage COVID-19 Pneumonia samples (very limited or no
infection signs) labelled by the medical doctors and 1579 samples for control
(normal) class. A detailed set of experiments show that the CSEN achieves the
top (over 98.5%) sensitivity with over 96% specificity. Moreover, transfer
learning over the deep CheXNet fine-tuned with the augmented data produces the
leading performance among other deep networks with 97.14% sensitivity and
99.49% specificity.

    <title>Stochastic approach to study control strategies of Covid-19 pandemic in
  India</title>
    <summary>  India is one of the worst affected countries by the Covid-19 pandemic at
present. We studied publicly available data of the Covid-19 patients in India
and analyzed possible impacts of quarantine and social distancing within the
stochastic framework of the SEQIR model to illustrate the controlling strategy
of the pandemic. Our simulation results clearly show that proper quarantine and
social distancing should be maintained from an early time just at the start of
the pandemic and should be continued till its end to effectively control the
pandemic. This calls for a more socially disciplined lifestyle in this
perspective in future. The demographic stochasticity, which is quite visible in
the system dynamics, has a critical role in regulating and controlling the
pandemic.

    <title>Sparse HP Filter: Finding Kinks in the COVID-19 Contact Rate</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we estimate the time-varying COVID-19 contact rate of a
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Our measurement of the contact rate
is constructed using data on actively infected, recovered and deceased cases.
We propose a new trend filtering method that is a variant of the
Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, constrained by the number of possible kinks. We
term it the \emph{sparse HP filter} and apply it to daily data from five
countries: Canada, China, South Korea, the UK and the US. Our new method yields
the kinks that are well aligned with actual events in each country. We find
that the sparse HP filter provides a fewer kinks than the $\ell_1$ trend
filter, while both methods fitting data equally well. Theoretically, we
establish risk consistency of both the sparse HP and $\ell_1$ trend filters.
Ultimately, we propose to use time-varying $\textit{contact growth rates}$ to
document and monitor outbreaks of COVID-19.

    <title>Epidemics, the Ising-model and percolation theory: a comprehensive
  review focussed on Covid-19</title>
    <summary>  We revisit well-established concepts of epidemiology, the Ising-model, and
percolation theory. Also, we employ a spin $S$ = 1/2 Ising-like model and a
(logistic) Fermi-Dirac-like function to describe the spread of Covid-19. Our
analysis reinforces well-established literature results, namely: \emph{i}) that
the epidemic curves can be described by a Gaussian-type function; \emph{ii})
that the temporal evolution of the accumulative number of infections and
fatalities follow a logistic function, which has some resemblance with a
distorted Fermi-Dirac-like function; \emph{iii}) the key role played by the
quarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an \emph{interacting}
parameter, which emulates the contact between infected and non-infected people.
Furthermore, in the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that:
\emph{i}) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of
a person being infected with Covid-19; \emph{ii}) the concepts of blocked and
non-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person
respecting or not the social distancing, impacting thus in the probability of
an infected person to infect other people. Increasing the number of infected
people leads to an increase in the number of net connections, giving rise thus
to a higher probability of new infections (percolation). We demonstrate the
importance of social distancing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 in a
pedagogical way. Given the impossibility of making a precise forecast of the
disease spread, we highlight the importance of taking into account additional
factors, such as climate changes and urbanization, in the mathematical
description of epidemics. Yet, we make a connection between the standard
mathematical models employed in epidemics and well-established concepts in
condensed matter Physics, such as the Fermi gas and the Landau Fermi-liquid
picture.

    <title>On the Evolution of Covid-19 in Italy: a Follow up Note</title>
    <summary>  In a previous note we made an analysis of the spreading of the COVID disease
in Italy. We used a model based on the logistic and Hubbert functions, the
analysis we exploited has shown limited usefulness in terms of predictions and
failed in fixing fundamental indications like the point of inflection of the
disease growth. In this note we elaborate on the previous model, using
multi-logistic models and attempt a more realistic analysis.

    <title>Cross-Country Age Disparities in COVID-19 Cases with Hospitalization,
  ICU Usage, and Morbidity</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we examine cross-country differences, in terms of the age
distribution of symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU)
cases, and fatalities due to the novel COVID-19. By calculating conditional
probabilities, we bridge country-level incidence data gathered from different
countries and attribute the variability in data to country demographics. We
then provide case, hospitalization, ICU, and fatality estimates for a
comprehensive list of countries using the existing data from a variety of
countries.

    <title>The impact of a nation-wide lockdown on COVID-19 transmissibility in
  Italy</title>
    <summary>  On March 10, 2020, Italy imposed a national lockdown to curtail the spread of
COVID-19. Here we estimate that, fourteen days after the implementation of the
strategy, the net reproduction number has dropped below the epidemic threshold
- estimated range 0.4-0.7. Our findings provide a timeline of the effectiveness
of the implemented lockdown, which is relevant for a large number of countries
that followed Italy in enforcing similar measures.

    <title>Spatiotemporal Dynamics, Nowcasting and Forecasting of COVID-19 in the
  United States</title>
    <summary>  In response to the ongoing public health emergency of COVID-19, we
investigate the disease dynamics to understand the spread of COVID-19 in the
United States. In particular, we focus on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the
disease, accounting for the control measures, environmental effects,
socioeconomic factors, health service resources, and demographic conditions
that vary from different counties. In the modeling of an epidemic, mathematical
models are useful, however, pure mathematical modeling is deterministic, and
only demonstrates the average behavior of the epidemic; thus, it is difficult
to quantify the uncertainty. Instead, statistical models provide varieties of
characterization of different types of errors. In this paper, we investigate
the disease dynamics by working at the interface of theoretical models and
empirical data by combining the advantages of mathematical and statistical
models. We develop a novel nonparametric space-time disease transmission model
for the epidemic data, and to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread
of COVID-19 at the county level. The proposed methodology can be used to
dissect the spatial structure and dynamics of spread, as well as to forecast
how this outbreak may unfold through time and space in the future. To assess
the uncertainty, projection bands are constructed from forecast paths obtained
in bootstrap replications. A dashboard is established with multiple R shiny
apps embedded to provide a 7-day forecast of the COVID-19 infection count and
death count up to the county level, as well as a long-term projection of the
next four months. The proposed method provides remarkably accurate short-term
prediction results.

    <title>Curating a COVID-19 data repository and forecasting county-level death
  counts in the United States</title>
    <summary>  As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, accurate forecasting continues
to play an extremely important role in informing policy decisions. In this
paper, we collate a large data repository containing COVID-19 information from
a range of different sources. We use this data to develop several predictors
and prediction intervals for forecasting the short-term (e.g., over the next
week) trajectory of COVID-19-related recorded deaths at the county-level in the
United States. Specifically, using data from January 22, 2020, to May 10, 2020,
we produce several different predictors and combine their forecasts using
ensembling techniques, resulting in an ensemble we refer to as Combined Linear
and Exponential Predictors (CLEP). Our individual predictors include
county-specific exponential and linear predictors, an exponential predictor
that pools data together across counties, and a demographics-based exponential
predictor. In addition, we use the largest prediction errors in the past five
days to assess the uncertainty of our death predictions, resulting in
prediction intervals that we refer to as Maximum (absolute) Error Prediction
Intervals (MEPI). We show that MEPI is an effective method in practice with a
94.5\% coverage rate when averaged across counties. Our forecasts are already
being used by the non-profit organization, Response4Life, to determine the
medical supply need for individual hospitals and have directly contributed to
the distribution of medical supplies across the country. We hope that our
forecasts and data repository can help guide necessary county-specific
decision-making and help counties prepare for their continued fight against
COVID-19. All collected data, modeling code, forecasts, and visualizations are
updated daily and available at

    <title>Trading Privacy for the Greater Social Good: How Did America React
  During COVID-19?</title>
    <summary>  Digital contact tracing and analysis of social distancing from smartphone
location data are two prime examples of non-therapeutic interventions used in
many countries to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many
understand the importance of trading personal privacy for the public good,
others have been alarmed at the potential for surveillance via measures enabled
through location tracking on smartphones. In our research, we analyzed massive
yet atomic individual-level location data containing over 22 billion records
from ten Blue (Democratic) and ten Red (Republican) cities in the U.S., based
on which we present, herein, some of the first evidence of how Americans
responded to the increasing concerns that government authorities, the private
sector, and public health experts might use individual-level location data to
track the COVID-19 spread. First, we found a significant decreasing trend of
mobile-app location-sharing opt-out. Whereas areas with more Democrats were
more privacy-concerned than areas with more Republicans before the advent of
the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the overall opt-out
rates after COVID-19, and this effect was more salient among Democratic than
Republican cities. Second, people who practiced social distancing (i.e., those
who traveled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic)
were also less likely to opt-out, whereas the converse was true for people who
practiced less social-distancing. This relationship also was more salient among
Democratic than Republican cities. Third, high-income populations and males,
compared with low-income populations and females, were more
privacy-conscientious and more likely to opt-out of location tracking.

    <title>Age-structured estimation of COVID-19 ICU demand from low quality data</title>
    <summary>  We sample aggravated cases following age-structured probabilities from
confirmed cases and use ICU occupation data to find a subnotification factor. A
logistic fit is then employed to project the progression of the COVID-19
epidemic with plateau scenarios taken from locations that have reached this
stage. Finally, the logistic curve found is corrected by the subnotification
factor and sampled to project the future demand for ICU beds.

    <title>A SIR model assumption for the spread of COVID-19 in different
  communities</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the modelling approach on the
pandemic due to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 disease and develop a
susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model that provides a theoretical framework
to investigate its spread within a community. Here, the model is based upon the
well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a
total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of
susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we
show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we
investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse
significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities,
represented by countries and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can
provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in
communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance
of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as
it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable
predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020,
the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of
strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters
related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected
and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data
with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of
COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper
restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates
early from the spread of the disease.

    <title>Lung Infection Quantification of COVID-19 in CT Images with Deep
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  CT imaging is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and staging COVID-19
infection. Follow-up scans every 3-5 days are often recommended for disease
progression. It has been reported that bilateral and peripheral ground glass
opacification (GGO) with or without consolidation are predominant CT findings
in COVID-19 patients. However, due to lack of computerized quantification
tools, only qualitative impression and rough description of infected areas are
currently used in radiological reports. In this paper, a deep learning
(DL)-based segmentation system is developed to automatically quantify infection
regions of interest (ROIs) and their volumetric ratios w.r.t. the lung. The
performance of the system was evaluated by comparing the automatically
segmented infection regions with the manually-delineated ones on 300 chest CT
scans of 300 COVID-19 patients. For fast manual delineation of training samples
and possible manual intervention of automatic results, a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) strategy has been adopted to assist radiologists for infection region
segmentation, which dramatically reduced the total segmentation time to 4
minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. The average Dice simiarility
coefficient showed 91.6% agreement between automatic and manual infaction
segmentations, and the mean estimation error of percentage of infection (POI)
was 0.3% for the whole lung. Finally, possible applications, including but not
limited to analysis of follow-up CT scans and infection distributions in the
lobes and segments correlated with clinical findings, were discussed.

    <title>On Identifying and Mitigating Bias in the Estimation of the COVID-19
  Case Fatality Rate</title>
    <summary>  The relative case fatality rates (CFRs) between groups and countries are key
measures of relative risk that guide policy decisions regarding scarce medical
resource allocation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the middle of an
active outbreak when surveillance data is the primary source of information,
estimating these quantities involves compensating for competing biases in time
series of deaths, cases, and recoveries. These include time- and severity-
dependent reporting of cases as well as time lags in observed patient outcomes.
In the context of COVID-19 CFR estimation, we survey such biases and their
potential significance. Further, we analyze theoretically the effect of certain
biases, like preferential reporting of fatal cases, on naive estimators of CFR.
We provide a partially corrected estimator of these naive estimates that
accounts for time lag and imperfect reporting of deaths and recoveries. We show
that collection of randomized data by testing the contacts of infectious
individuals regardless of the presence of symptoms would mitigate bias by
limiting the covariance between diagnosis and death. Our analysis is
supplemented by theoretical and numerical results and a simple and fast
open-source codebase at https://github.com/aangelopoulos/cfr-covid-19 .

    <title>COVID-19 epidemic outcome predictions based on logistic fitting and
  estimation of its reliability</title>
    <summary>  Since the first outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic at the end of 2019, data
has been made available on the number of infections, deaths and recoveries for
all countries of the World, and that data can be used for statistical analysis.
The primary interest of this paper is how well the logistic equation can
predict the outcome of COVID-19 epidemic in any regions of the World assuming
that the methodology of the testing process, namely the data collection method
and social behavior is not changing over the course of time. Besides the social
relevance, this study has two scientific purposes: we investigate if a simple
saturation model can describe the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic and if so, we
would like to determine, from which point during the epidemic the fitting
parameters provide reliable predictions. We also give estimations for the
outcome of this epidemic in several countries based on the logistic model and
the data available on 27 March, 2020. Based on the saturated cases in China, we
have managed to find some criteria to judge the reliability of the predictions.

    <title>A large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter dataset for open scientific
  research -- an international collaboration</title>
    <summary>  As the COVID-19 pandemic continues its march around the world, an
unprecedented amount of open data is being generated for genetics and
epidemiological research. The unparalleled rate at which many research groups
around the world are releasing data and publications on the ongoing pandemic is
allowing other scientists to learn from local experiences and data generated in
the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a need to integrate
additional data sources that map and measure the role of social dynamics of
such a unique world-wide event into biomedical, biological, and epidemiological
analyses. For this purpose, we present a large-scale curated dataset of over
152 million tweets, growing daily, related to COVID-19 chatter generated from
January 1st to April 4th at the time of writing. This open dataset will allow
researchers to conduct a number of research projects relating to the emotional
and mental responses to social distancing measures, the identification of
sources of misinformation, and the stratified measurement of sentiment towards
the pandemic in near real time.

    <title>Limited containment options of COVID-19 outbreak revealed by regional
  agent-based simulations for South Africa</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has spread from China across Europe and the United States and has
become a global pandemic. In countries of the Global South, due to often weaker
socioeconomic options and health care systems, effective local countermeasures
remain debated. We combine large-scale socioeconomic and traffic survey data
with detailed agent-based simulations of local transportation to analyze
COVID-19 spreading in a regional model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality
in South Africa under a range of countermeasure scenarios. The simulations
indicate that any realistic containment strategy, including those similar to
the one ongoing in South Africa, may yield a manifold overload of available
intensive care units (ICUs). Only immediate and the most severe
countermeasures, up to a complete lock-down that essentially inhibits all joint
human activities, can contain the epidemic effectively.
  As South Africa exhibits rather favorable conditions compared to many other
countries of the Global South, our findings constitute rough conservative
estimates and may support identifying strategies towards containing COVID-19 as
well as any major future pandemics in these countries.

    <title>Flattening the curves: on-off lock-down strategies for COVID-19 with an
  application to Brazi</title>
    <summary>  The current COVID-19 pandemic is affecting different countries in different
ways. The assortment of reporting techniques alongside other issues, such as
underreporting and budgetary constraints, makes predicting the spread and
lethality of the virus a challenging task. This work attempts to gain a better
understanding of how COVID-19 will affect one of the least studied countries,
namely Brazil. Currently, several Brazilian states are in a state of lock-down.
However, there is political pressure for this type of measures to be lifted.
This work considers the impact that such a termination would have on how the
virus evolves locally. This was done by extending the SEIR model with an on /
off strategy. Given the simplicity of SEIR we also attempted to gain more
insight by developing a neural regressor. We chose to employ features that
current clinical studies have pinpointed has having a connection to the
lethality of COVID-19. We discuss how this data can be processed in order to
obtain a robust assessment.

    <title>Network Medicine Framework for Identifying Drug Repurposing
  Opportunities for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic demands the rapid identification of drug-repurpusing
candidates. In the past decade, network medicine had developed a framework
consisting of a series of quantitative approaches and predictive tools to study
host-pathogen interactions, unveil the molecular mechanisms of the infection,
identify comorbidities as well as rapidly detect drug repurpusing candidates.
Here, we adapt the network-based toolset to COVID-19, recovering the primary
pulmonary manifestations of the virus in the lung as well as observed
comorbidities associated with cardiovascular diseases. We predict that the
virus can manifest itself in other tissues, such as the reproductive system,
and brain regions, moreover we predict neurological comorbidities. We build on
these findings to deploy three network-based drug repurposing strategies,
relying on network proximity, diffusion, and AI-based metrics, allowing to rank
all approved drugs based on their likely efficacy for COVID-19 patients,
aggregate all predictions, and, thereby to arrive at 81 promising repurposing
candidates. We validate the accuracy of our predictions using drugs currently
in clinical trials, and an expression-based validation of selected candidates
suggests that these drugs, with known toxicities and side effects, could be
moved to clinical trials rapidly.

    <title>COVID-19 Time-series Prediction by Joint Dictionary Learning and Online
  NMF</title>
    <summary>  Predicting the spread and containment of COVID-19 is a challenge of utmost
importance that the broader scientific community is currently facing. One of
the main sources of difficulty is that a very limited amount of daily COVID-19
case data is available, and with few exceptions, the majority of countries are
currently in the "exponential spread stage," and thus there is scarce
information available which would enable one to predict the phase transition
between spread and containment.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predicting the spread of
COVID-19 based on dictionary learning and online nonnegative matrix
factorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of
short evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the
same time, so that their latent correlation structures are captured in the
dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from
the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online
NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to
the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by
the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,
we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results
can be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their
interpretability.

    <title>The resumption of sports competitions after COVID-19 lockdown: The case
  of the Spanish football league</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we present a stochastic discrete-time SEIR
(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model adapted to describe the
propagation of COVID-19 during a football tournament. Specifically, we are
concerned about the re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga,
which is currently -May 2020- stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our model
includes two additional states of an individual, confined and quarantined,
which are reached when an individual presents COVID-19 symptoms or has
undergone a virus test with a positive result. The model also accounts for the
interaction dynamics of players, considering three different sources of
infection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her team colleagues
during training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a match. Our
results highlight the influence of the days between matches, the frequency of
virus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at the end
of the season. Following our findings, we finally present a variety of
strategies to minimize the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case the
season of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.

    <title>#lockdown: network-enhanced emotional profiling at the times of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic forced countries all over the world to take
unprecedented measures like nationwide lockdowns. To adequately understand the
emotional and social repercussions, a large-scale reconstruction of how people
perceived these unexpected events is necessary but currently missing. We
address this gap through social media by introducing MERCURIAL (Multi-layer
Co-occurrence Networks for Emotional Profiling), a framework which exploits
linguistic networks of words and hashtags to reconstruct social discourse
describing real-world events. We use MERCURIAL to analyse 101,767 tweets from
Italy, the first country to react to the COVID-19 threat with a nationwide
lockdown. The data were collected between 11th and 17th March, immediately
after the announcement of the Italian lockdown and the WHO declaring COVID-19 a
pandemic. Our analysis provides unique insights into the psychological burden
of this crisis, focussing on: (i) the Italian official campaign for
self-quarantine (#iorestoacasa}), (ii) national lockdown (#italylockdown), and
(iii) social denounce (#sciacalli). Our exploration unveils evidence for the
emergence of complex emotional profiles, where anger and fear (towards
political debates and socio-economic repercussions) coexisted with trust,
solidarity, and hope (related to the institutions and local communities). We
discuss our findings in relation to mental well-being issues and coping
mechanisms, like instigation to violence, grieving, and solidarity. We argue
that our framework represents an innovative thermometer of emotional status, a
powerful tool for policy makers to quickly gauge feelings in massive audiences
and devise appropriate responses based on cognitive data.

    <title>Implication of Inter-State Movement of Migrant Workers during COVID 19
  Lockdown using Modified SEIR Model</title>
    <summary>  A modified SEIR model is used in the paper to evaluate the effect of
inter-state migrant worker transportation during the lockdown in India. The
model considers different levels of COVID-19 transmission during travel, daily
arrival rate and total migrant workers. Indian states with significant migrant
workers are considered to estimate the rise in confirmed and active COVID-19
cases. It is observed that reduced daily arrival rate of migrant workers can
help Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to lower the rise in confirmed and active cases.
By the end of May, 2020, the daily arrival rate of migrant workers will have
similar effect on Rajasthan. For the daily arrival rate of migrant workers
considered, Madhya Pradesh may experience higher rise in confirmed and active
cases. Maharashtra, on the other hand, may experience marginal rise in the
confirmed and active cases. A stringent policy to screen migrant workers for
possible trace COVID-19 virus prior to the travel and stricter isolation norm
after reaching the destination state can be helpful in reducing the rise in
confirmed and actives cases attributed to the migrant worker transportation.

    <title>Meta-Research: COVID-19 medical papers have fewer women first authors
  than expected</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in school closures and distancing
requirements that have disrupted both work and family life for many. Concerns
exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men
and women researchers equally. Many medical journals have published papers on
the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of
these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the
gender distribution of authors on 1,893 medical papers related to the pandemic
with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with
first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixed-effects
regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a
woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same
journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion
of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested
that women's representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was
particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020. Our findings are
consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women, especially
early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of
men.

    <title>Content analysis of Persian/Farsi Tweets during COVID-19 pandemic in
  Iran using NLP</title>
    <summary>  Iran, along with China, South Korea, and Italy was among the countries that
were hit hard in the first wave of the COVID-19 spread. Twitter is one of the
widely-used online platforms by Iranians inside and abroad for sharing their
opinion, thoughts, and feelings about a wide range of issues. In this study,
using more than 530,000 original tweets in Persian/Farsi on COVID-19, we
analyzed the topics discussed among users, who are mainly Iranians, to gauge
and track the response to the pandemic and how it evolved over time. We applied
a combination of manual annotation of a random sample of tweets and topic
modeling tools to classify the contents and frequency of each category of
topics. We identified the top 25 topics among which living experience under
home quarantine emerged as a major talking point. We additionally categorized
broader content of tweets that shows satire, followed by news, is the dominant
tweet type among the Iranian users. While this framework and methodology can be
used to track public response to ongoing developments related to COVID-19, a
generalization of this framework can become a useful framework to gauge Iranian
public reaction to ongoing policy measures or events locally and
internationally.

    <title>Non-Compulsory Measures Sufficiently Reduced Human Mobility in Japan
  during the COVID-19 Epidemic</title>
    <summary>  Large-scale mobility data collected from mobile phones provide us with an
opportunity to monitor and understand the impacts of non-pharmaceutical
interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak with an unprecedented
spatio-temporal granularity and scale. While such data has been used in various
countries, the changes in mobility patterns in Japan where interventions were
limited to non-compulsory measures, has been under-studied. Here, we analyzed
the temporal changes in i) human mobility behavior, ii) social contact rates,
and iii) correlations between changes in such mobility metrics with the
transmissibility of COVID-19, using anonymized large-scale mobility data
collected from more than 200K mobile phone users in Tokyo, Japan. The analysis
concludes that by April 15th (1 week from declaring state of emergency),
aggregated quantities characterizing human mobility behavior decreased by
around 50%, resulting in a 70% reduction of social contacts in Tokyo, showing
the effectiveness of non-compulsory measures. Mobility behavior had, in fact,
already decreased to 60% of typical weekdays before the declaration of the
state of emergency. Furthermore, the reduction in human mobility metrics and
social contact measures showed significant and strong correlation with the
decrease of the estimated effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in Japan.
The obtained empirical insights could inform policy makers on deciding the
sufficient levels of mobility reduction to contain the disease.

    <title>COVID-19 Public Opinion and Emotion Monitoring System Based on Time
  Series Thermal New Word Mining</title>
    <summary>  With the spread and development of new epidemics, it is of great reference
value to identify the changing trends of epidemics in public emotions. We
designed and implemented the COVID-19 public opinion monitoring system based on
time series thermal new word mining. A new word structure discovery scheme
based on the timing explosion of network topics and a Chinese sentiment
analysis method for the COVID-19 public opinion environment is proposed.
Establish a "Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter" distributed crawler framework to collect
data. The system can judge the positive and negative emotions of the reviewer
based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth of the seven emotions
such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the sentiment
discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error
of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results
show that our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant
error. We designed a large data visualization screen, which can clearly show
the trend of public emotions, the proportion of various emotion categories,
keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and intuitively reflect the development
of public opinion.

    <title>Forecasting the Spread of Covid-19 Under Control Scenarios Using LSTM
  and Dynamic Behavioral Models</title>
    <summary>  To accurately predict the regional spread of Covid-19 infection, this study
proposes a novel hybrid model which combines a Long short-term memory (LSTM)
artificial recurrent neural network with dynamic behavioral models. Several
factors and control strategies affect the virus spread, and the uncertainty
arisen from confounding variables underlying the spread of the Covid-19
infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the effect of multiple
factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of cases and deaths
across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia. The results show that
the proposed model closely replicates test data. It not only provides accurate
predictions but also estimates the daily behavior of the system under
uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the LSTM model accounting for limited
available data. The parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using a
genetic algorithm for each country to improve the prediction power while
considering regional properties. Since the proposed model can accurately
predict Covid-19 spread under consideration of containment policies, is capable
of being used for policy assessment, planning and decision-making.

    <title>Efficient adaptive designs for clinical trials of interventions for
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented response in terms of
clinical research activity. An important part of this research has been focused
on randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate potential therapies for
COVID-19. The results from this research need to be obtained as rapidly as
possible. This presents a number of challenges associated with considerable
uncertainty over the natural history of the disease and the number and
characteristics of patients affected, and the emergence of new potential
therapies. These challenges make adaptive designs for clinical trials a
particularly attractive option. Such designs allow a trial to be modified on
the basis of interim analysis data or stopped as soon as sufficiently strong
evidence has been observed to answer the research question, without
compromising the trial's scientific validity or integrity. In this paper we
describe some of the adaptive design approaches that are available and discuss
particular issues and challenges associated with their use in the pandemic
setting. Our discussion is illustrated by details of four ongoing COVID-19
trials that have used adaptive designs.

    <title>Exploration of Interpretability Techniques for Deep COVID-19
  Classification using Chest X-ray Images</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of COVID-19 has shocked the entire world with its fairly rapid
spread and has challenged different sectors. One of the most effective ways to
limit its spread is the early and accurate diagnosis of infected patients.
Medical imaging such as X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) combined with the
potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an essential role in supporting
the medical staff in the diagnosis process. Thereby, the use of five different
deep learning models (ResNet18, ResNet34, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and
DenseNet161) and their Ensemble have been used in this paper, to classify
COVID-19, pneumoni{\ae} and healthy subjects using Chest X-Ray. Multi-label
classification was performed to predict multiple pathologies for each patient,
if present. Foremost, the interpretability of each of the networks was
thoroughly studied using techniques like occlusion, saliency, input X gradient,
guided backpropagation, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT. The mean Micro-F1
score of the models for COVID-19 classifications ranges from 0.66 to 0.875, and
is 0.89 for the Ensemble of the network models. The qualitative results
depicted the ResNets to be the most interpretable model.

    <title>Clinical Trial Drug Safety Assessment for Studies and Submissions
  Impacted by COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we provide guidance on how standard safety analyses and
reporting of clinical trial safety data may need to be modified, given the
potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact could include missed
visits, alternative methods for assessments (such as virtual visits),
alternative locations for assessments (such as local labs), and study drug
interruptions. We focus on safety planning for Phase 2-4 clinical trials and
integrated summaries for submissions. Starting from the recommended safety
analyses proposed in white papers and a workshop, created as part of an
FDA/PHUSE collaboration (PHUSE 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), we assess what
modifications might be needed. Impact from COVID-19 will likely affect
treatment arms equally, so analyses of adverse events from controlled data can,
to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from
uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will
require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for
safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher
incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel
restrictions (e.g., depression). Analyses of laboratory measurements may need
to be modified to account for the combination of measurements from local and
central laboratories.

    <title>Pandemic Pulse: Unraveling and Modeling Social Signals during the
  COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  We present and begin to explore a collection of social data that represents
part of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on the United States. This data is
collected from a range of sources and includes longitudinal trends of news
topics, social distancing behaviors, community mobility changes, web searches,
and more. This multimodal effort enables new opportunities for analyzing the
impacts such a pandemic has on the pulse of society. Our preliminary results
show that the number of COVID-19-related news articles published immediately
after the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on March 11, and that
since that time have steadily decreased---regardless of changes in the number
of cases or public policies. Additionally, we found that politically moderate
and scientifically-grounded sources have, relative to baselines measured before
the beginning of the pandemic, published a lower proportion of COVID-19 news
than more politically extreme sources. We suggest that further analysis of
these multimodal signals could produce meaningful social insights and present
an interactive dashboard to aid further exploration.

    <title>Dutch General Public Reaction on Governmental COVID-19 Measures and
  Announcements in Twitter Data</title>
    <summary>  Public sentiment (the opinion, attitude or feeling that the public expresses)
is a factor of interest for government, as it directly influences the
implementation of policies. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19
crisis, having an up-to-date representation of public sentiment on governmental
measures and announcements is crucial. While the staying-at-home policy makes
face-to-face interactions and interviews challenging, analysing real-time
Twitter data that reflects public opinion toward policy measures is a
cost-effective way to access public sentiment. In this paper, we collect
streaming data using the Twitter API starting from the COVID-19 outbreak in the
Netherlands in February 2020, and track Dutch general public reactions on
governmental measures and announcements. We provide temporal analysis of tweet
frequency and public sentiment over the past four months. We also identify
public attitudes towards the Dutch policy on wearing face masks in a case
study. By presenting those preliminary results, we aim to provide visibility
into the social media discussions around COVID-19 to the general public,
scientists and policy makers. The data collection and analysis will be updated
and expanded over time.

    <title>Augmented Curation of Unstructured Clinical Notes from a Massive EHR
  System Reveals Specific Phenotypic Signature of Impending COVID-19 Diagnosis</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 patient phenotypes is
necessary to derive fine-grained resolution of pathophysiology. Here we use
state-of-the-art deep neural networks over an institution-wide machine
intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 15.8 million clinical notes
from 30,494 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR diagnostic testing. By
contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of
COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=635) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg,
n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we
identify anosmia/dysgeusia (37.4-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2.6-fold), diarrhea
(2.2-fold), fever/chills (2.1-fold), respiratory difficulty (1.9-fold), and
cough (1.8-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients.
The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 3.2-fold amplification in
COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with
anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19
(4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an
Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional
knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling
up curation throughput, with minimal need for retraining underlying neural
networks, thus promising EHR-powered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of
diseases.

    <title>Analysis of Spatial-temporal Behavior Pattern of the Share Bike Usage
  during COVID-19 Pandemic in Beijing</title>
    <summary>  During the epidemics of COVID-19, the whole world is experiencing a serious
crisis on public health and economy. Detailed information in the behavior of
residents during epidemic benefits emergency management when one tries to
design intervention strategies and resilience measures. From the perspective of
movements, the widely used Bike Sharing System (BSS) in China is capable of
characterizing the behavior patterns over time &amp; space within big cities.
Although share bikes are playing an important role as data sources in data
mining, they could be of help but are rarely reported in pandemic-related
researches. Based on the share bike records in Beijing, we constructed a
behavior pattern analysis framework, then analyzed the spatiotemporal behavior
patterns of residents, figured out the key time nodes of different pandemic
periods, and demonstrated the variations in mobility due to the onset of the
COVID-19 threat and administrative restrictions. The impact of the pandemic was
assessed by performing co-location analysis between share bike usage and POIs
(Point Of Interest). Classification of POIs is helpful to distinguish the
behavior patterns generated by various the productive and social activities.
Discussions with evolving confirmed COVID-19 cases suggest the effectiveness
and necessity of the public interventions in the COVID-19 containment during
the resilience period. These findings provide critical information on how to
respond to the current COVID-19 outbreak and other epidemic events.

    <title>Estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers underlying
  epidemiological processes: a new statistical tool for the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus pandemic has rapidly evolved into an unprecedented crisis.
The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model and its variants have been used
for modeling the pandemic. However, time-independent parameters in the
classical models may not capture the dynamic transmission and removal
processes, governed by virus containment strategies taken at various phases of
the epidemic. Moreover, very few models account for possible inaccuracies of
the reported cases. We propose a Poisson model with time-dependent transmission
and removal rates to account for possible random errors in reporting and
estimate a time-dependent disease reproduction number, which may be used to
assess the effectiveness of virus control strategies. We apply our method to
study the pandemic in several severely impacted countries, and analyze and
forecast the evolving spread of the coronavirus. We have developed an
interactive web application to facilitate readers' use of our method.

    <title>Using early data to estimate the actual infection fatality ratio from
  COVID-19 in France (Running title: Infection fatality ratio from COVID-19)</title>
    <summary>  The first cases of COVID-19 in France were detected on January 24, 2020. The
number of screening tests carried out and the methodology used to target the
patients tested do not allow for a direct computation of the real number of
cases and the mortality rate.In this report, we develop a
'mechanistic-statistical' approach coupling a SIR ODE model describing the
unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data
acquisition process and a statistical inference method. The objective of this
model is not to make forecasts but to estimate the real number of people
infected with COVID-19 during the observation window in France and to deduce
the mortality rate associated with the epidemic.Main results. The actual number
of infected cases in France is probably much higher than the observations: we
find here a factor x 15 (95%-CI: 4-33), which leads to a 5.2/1000 mortality
rate (95%-CI: 1.5 / 1000-11.7/ 1000) at the end of the observation period. We
find a R0 of 4.8, a high value which may be linked to the long viral shedding
period of 20 days.

    <title>Modelling the second wave of COVID-19 infections in France and Italy via
  a Stochastic SEIR model</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has forced quarantine measures in several countries across the
world. These measures have proven to be effective in significantly reducing the
prevalence of the virus. To date, no effective treatment or vaccine is
available. In the effort of preserving both public health as well as the
economical and social textures, France and Italy governments have partially
released lockdown measures. Here we extrapolate the long-term behavior of the
epidemics in both countries using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered
(SEIR) model where parameters are stochastically perturbed to handle the
uncertainty in the estimates of COVID-19 prevalence. Our results suggest that
uncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions rapidly propagate in
the model and can result in different outcomes of the epidemics leading or not
to a second wave of infections. Using actual knowledge, asymptotic estimates of
COVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of order of ten millions units in both
countries.

    <title>Racism is a Virus: Anti-Asian Hate and Counterhate in Social Media
  during the COVID-19 Crisis</title>
    <summary>  The spread of COVID-19 has sparked racism, hate, and xenophobia in social
media targeted at Chinese and broader Asian communities. However, little is
known about how racial hate spreads during a pandemic and the role of
counterhate speech in mitigating the spread. Here we study the evolution and
spread of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create
COVID-HATE, the largest dataset of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning
three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and a social network with over
87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets, we
train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves
an average AUROC of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate
tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find
that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19 discussions prior to
their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards
compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful
users and are more vocal and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot
accounts, we show that hateful bots are more successful in attracting followers
compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network reveals that
hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another,
instead of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that
hate is contagious and nodes are highly likely to become hateful after being
exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis reveals that counterhate
messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place. Overall,
this work presents a comprehensive overview of anti-Asian hate and counterhate
content during a pandemic. The COVID-HATE dataset is available at
http://claws.cc.gatech.edu/covid.

    <title>Effects of Population Co-location Reduction on Cross-county Transmission
  Risk of COVID-19 in the United States</title>
    <summary>  The rapid spread of COVID-19 in the United States has imposed a major threat
to public health, the real economy, and human well-being. With the absence of
effective vaccines, the preventive actions of social distancing and travel
reduction are recognized as essential non-pharmacologic approaches to control
the spread of COVID-19. Prior studies demonstrated that human movement and
mobility drove the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 in China. Little is
known, however, about the patterns and effects of co-location reduction on
cross-county transmission risk of COVID-19. This study utilizes Facebook
co-location data for all counties in the United States from March to early May
2020. The analysis examines the synchronicity and time lag between travel
reduction and pandemic growth trajectory to evaluate the efficacy of social
distancing in ceasing the population co-location probabilities, and
subsequently the growth in weekly new cases. The results show that the
mitigation effects of co-location reduction appear in the growth of weekly new
cases with one week of delay. Furthermore, significant segregation is found
among different county groups which are categorized based on numbers of cases.
The results suggest that within-group co-location probabilities remain stable,
and social distancing policies primarily resulted in reduced cross-group
co-location probabilities (due to travel reduction from counties with large
number of cases to counties with low numbers of cases). These findings could
have important practical implications for local governments to inform their
intervention measures for monitoring and reducing the spread of COVID-19, as
well as for adoption in future pandemics. Public policy, economic forecasting,
and epidemic modeling need to account for population co-location patterns in
evaluating transmission risk of COVID-19 across counties.

    <title>English dictionaries, gold and silver standard corpora for biomedical
  natural language processing related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Here we present a toolbox for natural language processing tasks related to
SARS-CoV-2. It comprises English dictionaries of synonyms for SARS-CoV-2 and
COVID-19, a silver standard corpus generated with the dictionaries and a gold
standard corpus of 10 Pubmed abstracts manually annotated for disease, virus,
symptom and protein/gene terms. This toolbox is freely available on github (on
https://github.com/Aitslab/corona) and can be used for text analytics in a
variety of settings related to the COVID-19 crisis. It will be expanded and
applied in NLP tasks over the next weeks and the community is invited to
contribute.

    <title>Early Outbreak Detection for Proactive Crisis Management Using Twitter
  Data: COVID-19 a Case Study in the US</title>
    <summary>  During a disease outbreak, timely non-medical interventions are critical in
preventing the disease from growing into an epidemic and ultimately a pandemic.
However, taking quick measures requires the capability to detect the early
warning signs of the outbreak. This work collects Twitter posts surrounding the
2020 COVID-19 pandemic expressing the most common symptoms of COVID-19
including cough and fever, geolocated to the United States. Through examining
the variation in Twitter activities at the state level, we observed a temporal
lag between the rises in the number of symptom reporting tweets and officially
reported positive cases which varies between 5 to 19 days.

    <title>Getting Insights from a Large Corpus of Scientific Papers on
  Specialisted Comprehensive Topics -- the Case of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is one of the most important topic these days, specifically on
search engines and news. While fake news are easily shared, scientific papers
are reliable sources where information can be extracted. With about 24,000
scientific publications on COVID-19 and related research on PUBMED, automatic
computer-assisted analysis is required. In this paper, we develop two
methodologies to get insights on specific sub-topics of interest and latest
research sub-topics. They rely on natural language processing and graph-based
visualizations. We run these methodologies on two cases: the virus origin and
the uses of existing drugs.

    <title>Analysis and forecast of COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France</title>
    <summary>  In this note we analyze the temporal dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019
outbreak in China, Italy and France in the time window $22/01-09/03/2020$. A
first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the
epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be
meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading,
and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals.
  The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-(confirmed)
infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that
describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the
country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The
model places the peak in Italy around March 20$^{\rm th}$ 2020, with a maximum
number of confirmed infected individuals of about 16,000.

    <title>Abrupt declines in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide over China after the
  outbreak of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  China's policy interventions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease
2019 have environmental and economic impacts. Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide
indicates economic activities, as nitrogen dioxide is primarily emitted from
fossil fuel consumption. Satellite measurements show a 48% drop in tropospheric
nitrogen dioxide vertical column densities from the 20 days averaged before the
2020 Lunar New Year to the 20 days averaged after. This is 20% larger than that
from recent years. We relate to this reduction to two of the government's
actions: the announcement of the first report in each province and the date of
a province's lockdown. Both actions are associated with nearly the same
magnitude of reductions. Our analysis offers insights into the unintended
environmental and economic consequences through reduced economic activities.

    <title>Anomalous atmospheric circulation favored the spread of COVID-19 in
  Europe</title>
    <summary>  The current pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is having negative
health, social and economic consequences worldwide. In Europe, the pandemic
started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020.
It has subsequently spread over the continent, with special virulence in
northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual
persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during
February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and
Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, in terms of
air temperature and humidity, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the
virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that
the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated
in these regions may have favored the virus's propagation, by short-range
droplet transmission as well as likely by long-range aerosol (airborne)
transmission.

    <title>Prevalence of Low-Credibility Information on Twitter During the COVID-19
  Outbreak</title>
    <summary>  As the novel coronavirus spreads across the world, concerns regarding the
spreading of misinformation about it are also growing. Here we estimate the
prevalence of links to low-credibility information on Twitter during the
outbreak, and the role of bots in spreading these links. We find that the
combined volume of tweets linking to low-credibility information is comparable
to the volume of New York Times articles and CDC links. Content analysis
reveals a politicization of the pandemic. The majority of this content spreads
via retweets. Social bots are involved in both posting and amplifying
low-credibility information, although the majority of volume is generated by
likely humans. Some of these accounts appear to amplify low-credibility sources
in a coordinated fashion.

    <title>Mathematical Models for Describing and Predicting the COVID-19 Pandemic
  Crisis</title>
    <summary>  The present article studies the extension of two deterministic models for
describing the novel coronavirus pandemic crisis, the SIR model and the SEIR
model. The models were studied and compared to real data in order to support
the validity of each description and extract important information regarding
the pandemic, such as the basic reproductive number R0, which might provide
useful information concerning the rate of increase of the pandemic predicted by
each model. We next proceed to making predictions and comparing more complex
models derived from the SEIR model with the SIRD model, in order to find the
most suitable one for describing and predicting the pandemic crisis. Aiming to
answer the question if the simple SIRD model is able to make reliable
predictions and deliver suitable information compared to more complex models.

    <title>Using Reports of Own and Others' Symptoms and Diagnosis on Social Media
  to Predict COVID-19 Case Counts: Observational Infoveillance Study in
  Mainland China</title>
    <summary>  Can public social media data be harnessed to predict COVID-19 case counts? We
analyzed approximately 15 million COVID-19 related posts on Weibo, a popular
Twitter-like social media platform in China, from November 1, 2019 to March 31,
2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify "sick posts,"
which are reports of one's own and other people's symptoms and diagnosis
related to COVID-19. We then modeled the predictive power of sick posts and
other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. We found that reports of symptoms
and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts, up to 14
days ahead of official statistics. But other COVID-19 posts did not have
similar predictive power. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all
retrieved posts), we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei
province and the rest of mainland China, regardless of unequal distribution of
healthcare resources and outbreak timeline. Researchers and disease control
agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding
COVID-19. On top of monitoring overall search and posting activities, it is
crucial to sift through the contents and efficiently identify true signals from
noise.

    <title>Rational evaluation of various epidemic models based on the COVID-19
  data of China</title>
    <summary>  During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and also
challenging problems is to forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up
actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. However, to pick out a
reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of
various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat
of COVID-19 pandemics now.
  Based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported
during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast
ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference
methods and five dynamical models. We highlight the significance of a well
balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting,
as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike
information criterion, root mean square error and robustness index to evaluate
various epidemic models/methods.
  Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a
crucial role in forecasting. We further notice the Logistic function steadily
underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an
overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time
dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective
reproduction number into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in
the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential
growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the
inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast.
Towards the ODE models, the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models are shown to be suitable
for modeling the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the
inclusion of self-protection and quarantine.

    <title>Centralized and decentralized isolation strategies and their impact on
  the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics</title>
    <summary>  The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by
various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2
causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social
distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this
end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized
(C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and
analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous
complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is
necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is
insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with
the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy
at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees
to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that
stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the
outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for
the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus
reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find
that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the
adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a
region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an
understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our
investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into
understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak
infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to
understand and control over an extended period of time.

    <title>A fractional-order SEIHDR model for COVID-19 with inter-city networked
  coupling effects</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic
behavior of COVID-19. Based on inter-city networked coupling effects, a
fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March,
2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the
mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and
hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And
infectivity of individuals during incubation is also considered in this paper.
By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical
solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and
with the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23
January to $18-m$ March, 2020 where $m$ is equal to the number of prediction
days. Compared with integer-order system ($\alpha=0$), the fractional-order
model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on
Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case
without network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be
not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down
and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not
adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from
24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is
also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and
uniqueness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in
the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is
analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium
point is locally asymptotically stable when $R_0\le 1$, which provides a
theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future.

    <title>How Reliable are Test Numbers for Revealing the COVID-19 Ground Truth
  and Applying Interventions?</title>
    <summary>  The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is often used as a proxy for the
actual number of ground truth COVID-19 infected cases in both public discourse
and policy making. However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the
testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive
cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground
truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can
simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown
based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various
communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is
the presence of another `flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19,
that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be
tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using
census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data
to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework
to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic
Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location Based Testing policy
(LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come
out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with
very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases.
Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT,
gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare
the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe
that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and
significantly better than RST.

    <title>Using smartphones and wearable devices to monitor behavioural changes
  during COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Background In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19,
countries have adopted Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) such as social
distancing and full lockdown. An objective and quantitative means of monitoring
the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is urgently
required. Here we explore the utility of the recently developed open-source
mobile health platform RADAR-base as a toolbox to test the effect and response
to NPIs aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19. Methods We included 1062
participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the UK, and the Netherlands.
We derived features from the phone and wearable device for length of time spent
at home, distance travelled from home, heart rate, sleep, and patterns of phone
use. We visualised data using time series plots and performed statistical tests
to assess differences in behaviour during baseline, pre-, and post-lockdown
periods. Findings We found significant changes in behaviours between
baseline/pre-lockdown and post-lockdown for all features except total sleep
duration. In general, participants spent more time at home, travelled much
less, and were more active on their phones, interacting with others by using
social apps. Nevertheless, the response across nations differed with Denmark
showing attenuated changes in behaviour. Interpretation Differences in the
extracted features by country may reflect variations in communication and
implementation of different NPIs as well as cultural differences. We have
demonstrated that generalised open-source mobile health monitoring platforms
such as RADAR-base which leverages data from wearables and mobile technologies
are valuable tools for helping understand the behavioural impact of public
health interventions implemented in response to infectious outbreaks such as
COVID-19.

    <title>COVID-19 mitigation strategies and overview on results from relevant
  studies in Europe</title>
    <summary>  In December 2019, the first patients in Wuhan, China were diagnosed with a
primary atypical pneumonia, which showed to be unknown and contagious. Since
then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2,
has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the
crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The
results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for
improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform
beyond the current public health dogma called "flatten-the-curve". There are
several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases.
Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data,
these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in
the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that
epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that
assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19
pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other
and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the
simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen
whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures
taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the
quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that
countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates
in epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a
good framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing
the spread of COVID-19.

    <title>Socio-Economic Impacts of COVID-19 on Household Consumption and Poverty</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive economic shock across the world
due to business interruptions and shutdowns from social-distancing measures. To
evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic
model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household
income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a
crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can
use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period,
when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level.
The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a
lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance
(UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of
three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9%
in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income
earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the
combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero,
and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income
loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is
spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the
average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a
first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional
scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect
macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making
and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural
disasters).

    <title>Epidemic model on a network: analysis and applications to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We analyze an epidemic model on a network consisting of
susceptible-infected-recovered equations at the nodes coupled by diffusion
using a graph Laplacian. We introduce an epidemic criterion and examine
different vaccination/containment strategies: we prove that it is most
effective to vaccinate a node of highest degree. The model is also useful to
evaluate deconfinement scenarios and prevent a so-called second wave. The model
has few parameters enabling fitting to the data and the essential ingredient of
importation of infected; these features are particularly important for the
current COVID-19 epidemic.

    <title>Contact network models matching the dynamics of the COVID-19 spreading</title>
    <summary>  We study the epidemic spreading on spatial networks where the probability
that two nodes are connected decays with their distance as a power law. As the
exponent of the distance dependence grows, the model networks smoothly
transition from the random network limit to the regular lattice limit. We show
that despite keeping the average number of contacts constant, the increasing
exponent hampers the epidemic spreading by making long-distance connections
less frequent. The spreading dynamics is also influenced by the exponent value
and changes from exponential growth to power-law growth. The observed power-law
growth is compatible with recent analyses of the COVID-19 spreading in numerous
countries.

    <title>Prototype of an affordable pressure-controlled emergency mechanical
  ventilator for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We present a viable prototype of a simple mechanical ventilator intended as a
last resort to ventilate COVID-19 patients. The prototype implements the
pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation mode (PC-CMV) with
settable breathing rates, inspiration/expiration time ratios and FiO2
modulation. Although safe, the design aims to minimize the use of technical
components and those used are common in industry, so its construction may be
possible in times of logistical shortage or disruption or in areas with reduced
access to technical materials and at a moderate cost, affordable to lower
income countries. Most of the device can be manufactured by modest technical
means and construction plans are provided.

    <title>Strategies for the reuse of N95 and N99 respiratory masks during the
  COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic presents a strain of unprecedented scale on health
systems around the world. In order to reliably protect medical personnel, and
thus to contain the spread of the pandemic, it is essential to provide N95 or
N99 (European FFP2 or FFP3) respiratory masks (FFRs). Such masks are currently
in extreme shortage: To guarantee their supply sufficiently and for all cases,
it would absolutely necessary to reuse them. In recent years, the scientific
literature has laid out various possibilities to disinfect the FFRs for their
reuse several times. We identify the most promising disinfection methods for
the current critical situation (internationally) and project further methods
and modifications beyond these.

    <title>Open access institutional and news media tweet dataset for COVID-19
  social science research</title>
    <summary>  As COVID-19 quickly became one of the most concerned global crisis, the
demand for data in academic research is also increasing. Currently, there are
several open access Twitter datasets, but none of them is dedicated to the
institutional and news media Twitter data collection, to fill this blank, we
retrieved data from 69 institutional/news media Twitter accounts, 17 of them
were related to government and international organizations, 52 of them were
news media across North America, Europe and Asia. We believe our open access
data can provide researchers more availability to conduct social science
research.

    <title>Evidence of economic segregation from mobility lockdown during COVID-19
  epidemic</title>
    <summary>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, National governments have applied
lockdown restrictions to reduce the infection rate. We perform a massive
analysis on near real-time Italian data provided by Facebook to investigate how
lockdown strategies affect economic conditions of individuals and local
governments. We model the change in mobility as an exogenous shock similar to a
natural disaster. We identify two ways through which mobility restrictions
affect Italian citizens. First, we find that the impact of lockdown is stronger
in municipalities with higher fiscal capacity. Second, we find a segregation
effect, since mobility restrictions are stronger in municipalities for which
inequality is higher and where individuals have lower income per capita.

    <title>Inversion of a SIR-based model: a critical analysis about the
  application to COVID-19 epidemic</title>
    <summary>  Calibration of a SIR (Susceptibles-Infected-Recovered) model with official
international data for the COVID-19 pandemics provides a good example of the
difficulties inherent the solution of inverse problems. Inverse modeling is set
up in a framework of discrete inverse problems, which explicitly considers the
role and the relevance of data. Together with a physical vision of the model,
the present work addresses numerically the issue of parameters calibration in
SIR models, it discusses the uncertainties in the data provided by
international authorities, how they influence the reliability of calibrated
model parameters and, ultimately, of model predictions.

    <title>Public Concern and the Financial Markets during the COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <summary>  We measure the public concern during the outbreak of COVID-19 disease using
three data sources from Google Trends (YouTube, Google News, and Google
Search). Our findings are three-fold. First, the public concern in Italy is
found to be a driver of the concerns in other countries. Second, we document
that Google Trends data for Italy better explains the stock index returns of
France, Germany, Great Britain, the United States, and Spain with respect to
their country-based indicators. Finally, we perform a time-varying analysis and
identify that the most severe impacts in the financial markets occur at each
step of the Italian lock-down process.

    <title>Phenomenological dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic: meta-analysis for
  adjustment parameters</title>
    <summary>  We present a phenomenological way of dealing with the COVID-19 data provided
by government health agencies of eight different countries. Instead of using
the (exact or approximate) solutions to the SIR (or other) model(s) and trying
to adjust the time-independent parameters included in those models, we
introduce dynamical parameters whose time-dependence may be phenomenologically
obtained by adequately extrapolating a chosen subset of the daily provided
data. This phenomenological approach works extremely well to properly adjust
the number of infected (and removed) individuals in time, for the countries we
consider.

    <title>Optimal quarantine strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic in a population
  with a discrete age structure</title>
    <summary>  The goal of this work is to study the optimal controls for the COVID-19
epidemic in Brazil. We consider an age-structured SEIRQ model with quarantine
compartment, where the controls are the quarantine entrance parameters. We then
compare the optimal controls for different quarantine lengths and distribution
of the total control cost by assessing their respective reductions in deaths in
comparison to the same period without quarantine. The best strategy provides a
calendar of when to relax the isolation measures for each age group. Finally,
we analyse how a delay in the beginning of the quarantine affects this calendar
by changing the initial conditions.

    <title>Statistical Issues and Recommendations for Clinical Trials Conducted
  During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have major impacts on planned
and ongoing clinical trials. Its effects on trial data create multiple
potential statistical issues. The scale of impact is unprecedented, but when
viewed individually, many of the issues are well defined and feasible to
address. A number of strategies and recommendations are put forward to assess
and address issues related to estimands, missing data, validity and
modifications of statistical analysis methods, need for additional analyses,
ability to meet objectives and overall trial interpretability.

    <title>Digitalization of COVID-19 pandemic management and cyber risk from
  connected systems</title>
    <summary>  What makes cyber risks arising from connected systems challenging during the
management of a pandemic? Assuming that a variety of cyber-physical systems are
already operational-collecting, analyzing, and acting on data autonomously-what
risks might arise in their application to pandemic management? We already have
these systems operational, collecting, and analyzing data autonomously, so how
would a pandemic monitoring app be different or riskier? In this review
article, we discuss the digitalization of COVID-19 pandemic management and
cyber risk from connected systems.

    <title>On the interplay between mobility and hospitalization capacity during
  the COVID-19 pandemic: The SEIRHUD model</title>
    <summary>  Measures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic require a mix of
logistic, political and social capacity. Depending on the country, different
approaches to increase hospitalization capacity or to properly apply lock-downs
are observed. In order to better understand the impact of these measures we
have developed a compartmental model which, on the one hand allows to calibrate
the reduction of movement of people within and among different areas, and on
the other hand it incorporates a hospitalization dynamics that differentiates
the available kinds of treatment that infected people can receive. By bounding
the hospitalization capacity, we are able to study in detail the interplay
between mobility and hospitalization capacity.

    <title>COVID-19 Contact-Tracing Mobile Apps: Evaluation and Assessment for
  Decision Makers</title>
    <summary>  A number of groups, from governments to non-profits, have quickly acted to
innovate the contact-tracing process: they are designing, building, and
launching contact-tracing apps in response to the COVID-19 crisis. A diverse
range of approaches exist, creating challenging choices for officials looking
to implement contact-tracing technology in their community and raising concerns
about these choices among citizens asked to participate in contact tracing. We
are frequently asked how to evaluate and differentiate between the options for
contact-tracing applications. Here, we share the questions we ask about app
features and plans when reviewing the many contact-tracing apps appearing on
the global stage.

    <title>Modeling and Simulation of COVID-19 Pandemic for Cincinnati Tri-State
  Area</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we use SIR model to simulate the COVID-19 pandemic for
Cincinnati Tri-State Area. We have built a representative population of
Cincinnati that includes movements for traveling to stores, schools,
workplaces, and traveling to friends houses. Using this model, we simulate the
effect of quarantine, return to work, and panic buying. We show that that there
will be a second wave of infections when people return to work and significant
increase in number of infections when there is panic buying at stores with the
announcement of the quarantine measures.

    <title>Cyclical lock-down and the economic activity along the pandemic of
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The investigation focuses on an on-off protocol for controlling the COVID-19
widespread. The protocol establishes a working period of 4 days for all the
citizens, followed by 8 days of lock-down. We further propose splitting people
into smaller groups that undergo the on-off protocol, but shifted in time. This
procedure is expected to regularize the overall economic activity. Our results
show that either the on-of protocol and the splitting into groups reduces the
amount of infected people. However, the latter seems to be better for economic
reasons. Our simulations further show that the start-up time is a key issue for
the success of the implementation.

    <title>Significancia estadística del exceso de muertes en Chile durante
  pandemia COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The study of mortality and the calculation of excess deaths is a fundamental
tool for understanding the effect of epidemics / pandemics and the seasonal
cycles of endemic / epidemic diseases such as influenza, which is of great
importance in times of crisis, according to the WHO and different authors. In
this study, we analyzed the indicator of excess deaths in Chile during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneously, research is being carried out to corroborate
and characterize possible causes of the underestimation of deaths by official
health agencies.

    <title>Nowcasting Covid-19 statistics reported withdelay: a case-study of
  Sweden</title>
    <summary>  The new corona virus disease -- COVID-2019 -- is rapidly spreading through
the world. The availability of unbiased timely statistics of trends in disease
events are a key to effective responses. But due to reporting delays, the most
recently reported numbers are frequently underestimating of the total number of
infections, hospitalizations and deaths creating an illusion of a downward
trend. Here we describe a statistical methodology for predicting true daily
quantities and their uncertainty, estimated using historical reporting delays.
The methodology takes into account the observed distribution pattern of the
lag. It is derived from the removal method, a well-established estimation
framework in the field of ecology.

    <title>Spreading of infections on random graphs: A percolation-type model for
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We introduce an epidemic spreading model on a network using concepts from
percolation theory. The model is motivated by discussing the standard SIR
model, with extensions to describe effects of lockdowns within a population.
The underlying ideas and behavior of the lattice model, implemented using the
same lockdown scheme as for the SIR scheme, are discussed in detail and
illustrated with extensive simulations. A comparison between both models is
presented for the case of COVID-19 data from the USA. Both fits to the
empirical data are very good, but some differences emerge between the two
approaches which indicate the usefulness of having an alternative approach to
the widespread SIR model.

    <title>Extracting possibly representative COVID-19 Biomarkers from X-Ray images
  with Deep Learning approach and image data related to Pulmonary Diseases</title>
    <summary>  In this study, the problem of automatically classifying pulmonary diseases,
including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-Ray images, is considered.
While the spread of COVID-19 is increased, new, automatic, and reliable methods
for accurate detection are essential to reduce the exposure of the medical
experts to the outbreak. X-ray imaging, although limited to specific
visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. Deep Learning has proven to
be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from
medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional
Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to
investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification
task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-Ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases
is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve
remarkable results in related tasks. The results suggest that training CNNs
from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the
COVID-19 disease, while an overall classification accuracy of the seven classes
reaches 87.66%. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36%
Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.

    <title>A Model of Supply-Chain Decisions for Resource Sharing with an
  Application to Ventilator Allocation to Combat COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a stochastic optimization model for allocating and
sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different
entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory from a central
agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical
resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is
applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19
pandemic by the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the US Department of
Homeland Security (FEMA) to different states in the US. Findings suggest that
if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19
patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be
nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when more than 75% of the
available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients,
various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand
is assumed to be concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast
confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till
05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700
ventilators on 04/12/20. The results also suggest that in the
worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires between
7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak
demand. However, between 400 to 2,000 of these ventilators can be given to a
different state after the peak demand in NY has subsided.

    <title>SEIAR model with asymptomatic cohort and consequences to efficiency of
  quarantine government measures in COVID-19 epidemic</title>
    <summary>  We present a compartmental SEIAR model of epidemic spread as a generalization
of the SEIR model. We believe that the asymptomatic infectious cohort is an
omitted part of the understanding of the epidemic dynamics of disease COVID-19.
We introduce and derive the basic reproduction number as the weighted
arithmetic mean of the basic reproduction numbers of the symptomatic and
asymptomatic cohorts. Since the asymptomatic subjects people are not detected,
they can spread the disease much longer, and this increases the COVID-19 $R_0$
up to around 9. We show that European epidemic outbreaks in various European
countries correspond to the simulations with commonly used parameters based on
clinical characteristics of the disease COVID-19, but $R_0$ is around three
times bigger if the asymptomatic cohort is taken into account. Many voices in
the academic world are drawing attention to the asymptomatic group of
infectious subjects at present. We are convinced that the asymptomatic cohort
plays a crucial role in the spread of the COVID-19 disease, and it has to be
understood during government measures.

the most important controlling measure to fight against COVID-19. Many
countries have enforced 2 - 4 weeks' lockdown and are extending the period
depending on their current disease scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of
estimated communicability of COVID-19 prompted such decision. But the idea
that, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the
infection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time
(following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was
proposed by Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community
Size (CCS). Methods: We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease
dynamics. Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to
extinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of
lockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the
given country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have
identified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops
below CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it
is introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We
have calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown
days. Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19. On a
cautionary note, our model indicates another rise in infection almost a year
later but on a lesser magnitude.

    <title>Robust inference for nonlinear regression models from the Tsallis score:
  application to Covid-19 contagion in Italy</title>
    <summary>  We discuss an approach for fitting robust nonlinear regression models, which
can be employed to model and predict the contagion dynamics of the Covid-19 in
Italy. The focus is on the analysis of epidemic data using robust dose-response
curves, but the functionality is applicable to arbitrary nonlinear regression
models.

    <title>Effectiveness of Testing, Tracing, Social Distancing and Hygiene in
  Tackling Covid-19 in India: A System Dynamics Model</title>
    <summary>  We present a System Dynamics (SD) model of the Covid-19 pandemic spread in
India. The detailed age-structured compartment-based model endogenously
captures various disease transmission pathways, expanding significantly from
the standard SEIR model. The model is customized for India by using the
appropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices, external arrivals (as
per actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the reported
cases of Covid-19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent
time-variant levers, the effects of testing, contact tracing, isolating
Covid-positive patients, quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices,
social distancing through contact rate reductions at distinct zones of home(H),
work(W), school(S) and other(O) locations. Simulation results show that, even
after an extended lock-down, some non-trivial number of infections (even
asymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tools that
work against the pandemic is high rate of testing of those who show Covid-19
like symptoms, isolating them if they are positive and contact tracing all
contacts of positive patients and quarantining them, in combination with use of
face masks and personal hygiene. A wide range of combination of effectiveness
of contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal hygiene measures help
minimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in implementation of one
measure can be compensated by better implementation of other measures.

    <title>UMLS-ChestNet: A deep convolutional neural network for radiological
  findings, differential diagnoses and localizations of COVID-19 in chest
  x-rays</title>
    <summary>  In this work we present a method for the detection of radiological findings,
their location and differential diagnoses from chest x-rays. Unlike prior works
that focus on the detection of few pathologies, we use a hierarchical taxonomy
mapped to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) terminology to identify
189 radiological findings, 22 differential diagnosis and 122 anatomic
locations, including ground glass opacities, infiltrates, consolidations and
other radiological findings compatible with COVID-19. We train the system on
one large database of 92,594 frontal chest x-rays (AP or PA, standing, supine
or decubitus) and a second database of 2,065 frontal images of COVID-19
patients identified by at least one positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
test. The reference labels are obtained through natural language processing of
the radiological reports. On 23,159 test images, the proposed neural network
obtains an AUC of 0.94 for the diagnosis of COVID-19. To our knowledge, this
work uses the largest chest x-ray dataset of COVID-19 positive cases to date
and is the first one to use a hierarchical labeling schema and to provide
interpretability of the results, not only by using network attention methods,
but also by indicating the radiological findings that have led to the
diagnosis.

    <title>Is Working From Home The New Norm? An Observational Study Based on a
  Large Geo-tagged COVID-19 Twitter Dataset</title>
    <summary>  As the COVID-19 pandemic swept over the world, people discussed facts,
expressed opinions, and shared sentiments on social media. Since the reaction
to COVID-19 in different locations may be tied to local cases, government
regulations, healthcare resources and socioeconomic factors, we curated a large
geo-tagged Twitter dataset and performed exploratory analysis by location.
Specifically, we collected 650,563 unique geo-tagged tweets across the United
States (50 states and Washington, D.C.) covering the date range from January 25
to May 10, 2020. Tweet locations enabled us to conduct region-specific studies
such as tweeting volumes and sentiment, sometimes in response to local
regulations and reported COVID-19 cases. During this period, many people
started working from home. The gap between workdays and weekends in hourly
tweet volumes inspired us to propose algorithms to estimate work engagement
during the COVID-19 crisis. This paper also summarizes themes and topics of
tweets in our dataset using both social media exclusive tools (i.e., #hashtags,
@mentions) and the latent Dirichlet allocation model. We welcome requests for
data sharing and conversations for more insights.

    <title>Contractions, Hopf algebra extensions and cov. differential calculus</title>
    <summary>  We re-examine all the contractions related with the ${\cal U}_q(su(2))$
deformed algebra and study the consequences that the contraction process has
for their structure. We also show using ${\cal U}_q(su(2))\times{\cal U}(u(1))$
as an example that, as in the undeformed case, the contraction may generate
Hopf algebra cohomology. We shall show that most of the different Hopf algebra
deformations obtained have a bicrossproduct or a cocycle bicrossproduct
structure, for which we shall also give their dual `group' versions. The
bicovariant differential calculi on the deformed spaces associated with the
contracted algebras and the requirements for their existence are examined as
well.

    <title>Psychometric Analysis and Coupling of Emotions Between State Bulletins
  and Twitter in India during COVID-19 Infodemic</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 infodemic has been spreading faster than the pandemic itself. The
misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people's
health and governance systems. Since social media is the largest source of
information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating of
misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns
resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp
45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its
direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. In this study, we analyze the
psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official
bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look
at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified
the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep skip-gram
based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related
emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related
emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag
relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official
bulletins and social media using Granger's causality showed that state
bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical
Emergency. Further insights that are potentially relevant for the policymaker
and the communicators actively engaged in mitigating misinformation are also
discussed. Our paper also introduces CoronaIndiaDataset2, the first social
media based COVID-19 dataset at national and state levels from India with over
5.6 million national and 2.6 million state-level tweets. Finally, we present
our findings as COVibes, an interactive web application capturing psychometric
insights captured upon the CoronaIndiaDataset, both at a national and state
level.

    <title>A COVID-19 Epidemiological Model for Community and Policy Maker Use</title>
    <summary>  An epidemiological model for COVID-19 was developed and implemented in
MATLAB/GNU Octave for use by public health practitioners, policy makers and the
general public. The model distinguishes four stages in the disease: infected,
sick, seriously sick, and better. The model was preliminarily parameterized
based on observations of the spread of the disease. The model is consistent
with a mortality rate of 1.5 %. Preliminary simulations with the model indicate
that concepts such as "herd immunity" and "flattening the curve" are highly
misleading in the context of this virus. Public policies based on these
concepts are inadequate to protect the population. Only reducing the R0 of the
virus below 1 is an effective strategy for maintaining the death burden of
COVID-19 within the normal range of seasonal flu. As R0 values estimated with
the model range from 2.82 worldwide outside of China and 3.83 in the Western
world in late February - early March 2020, this means social distancing with
effectiveness greater than 65 % (worldwide) or 75 % (Western world) are needed
to combat the virus successfully.

    <title>Modeling and forecasting the early evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic in
  Brazil</title>
    <summary>  We model and forecast the early evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil
using Brazilian recent data from February 25, 2020 to March 30, 2020. This
early period accounts for unawareness of the epidemiological characteristics of
the disease in a new territory, sub-notification of the real numbers of
infected people and the timely introduction of social distancing policies to
flatten the spread of the disease. We use two variations of the SIR model and
we include a parameter that comprises the effects of social distancing
measures. Short and long term forecasts show that the social distancing policy
imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of infection of the
COVID-19. However, our results also show that if this policy does not last
enough time, it is only able to shift the peak of infection into the future
keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value. Furthermore, our long
term simulations forecast the optimal date to end the policy. Finally, we show
that the proportion of asymptomatic individuals affects the amplitude of the
peak of symptomatic infected, suggesting that it is important to test the
population.

    <title>Perception of emergent epidemic of COVID-2019 / SARS CoV-2 on the Polish
  Internet</title>
    <summary>  We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using
quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter,
Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry)
from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to
Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network
analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet
platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target
group. We identified three temporal major cluster of the interest before
disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on
all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special
law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day
of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of
interest when the Polish government declared war against disease with a massive
mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and
issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After
introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. We have
found out that Twitter reflected the structural division of the Polish
political sphere. We were able to identify clear communities of governing
party, mainstream oppostition and protestant group and potential sources of
misinformation. We have also detected bluring boundaries between comminities
after disease introduction.

    <title>SEIR and Regression Model based COVID-19 outbreak predictions in India</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 pandemic has become a major threat to the country. Till date, well
tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease. According
to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is
transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this
disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in
reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this
disease has been analysed for India till 30th March 2020 and predictions have
been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and
Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected
from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30th January 2020
to 30th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and
achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error
rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the
value of R0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02.
Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time. This
study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the
next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models
can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.

    <title>A Novel Methodology for Epidemic Risk Assessment: the case of COVID-19
  outbreak in Italy</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel data-driven framework for assessing the a-priori epidemic
risk of a geographical area and for identifying high-risk areas within a
country. Our risk index is evaluated as a function of three different
components: the hazard of the disease, the exposure of the area and the
vulnerability of its inhabitants. As an application, we discuss the case of
COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We characterize each of the twenty Italian regions
by using available historical data on air pollution, human mobility, winter
temperature, housing concentration, health care density, population size and
age. We find that the epidemic risk is higher in some of the Northern regions
with respect to Central and Southern Italy. The corresponding risk index shows
correlations with the available official data on the number of infected
individuals, patients in intensive care and deceased patients, and can help
explaining why regions such as Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto
have suffered much more than the rest of the country. Although the COVID-19
outbreak started in both North (Lombardia and Veneto) and Central Italy (Lazio)
almost at the same time, when the first cases were officially certified at the
beginning of 2020, the disease has spread faster and with heavier consequences
in regions with higher epidemic risk. Our framework can be extended and tested
on other epidemic data, such as those on seasonal flu, and applied to other
countries. We also present a policy model connected with our methodology, which
helps policy-makers to take informed decisions.

    <title>On the Inhibition of COVID-19 Protease by Indian Herbal Plants: An In
  Silico Investigation</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has quickly spread across the globe, becoming a pandemic. This
disease has a variable impact in different countries depending on their
cultural norms, mitigation efforts and health infrastructure. In India, a
majority of people rely upon traditional Indian medicine to treat human
maladies due to less-cost, easier availability and without any side-effect.
These medicines are made by herbal plants. This study aims to assess the Indian
herbal plants in the pursuit of potential COVID-19 inhibitors using in silico
approaches. We have considered 18 extracted compounds of 11 different species
of these plants. Our calculated lipophilicity, aqueous solubility and binding
affinity of the extracted compounds suggest that the inhibition potentials in
the order; harsingar &gt; aloe vera &gt; giloy &gt; turmeric &gt; neem &gt; ashwagandha &gt; red
onion &gt; tulsi &gt; cannabis &gt; black pepper. On comparing the binding affinity with
hydroxychloroquine, we note that the inhibition potentials of the extracts of
harsingar, aloe vera and giloy are very promising. Therefore, we believe that
these findings will open further possibilities and accelerate the works towards
finding an antidote for this malady.

    <title>Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports: Anonymization Process
  Description (version 1.0)</title>
    <summary>  This document describes the aggregation and anonymization process applied to
the initial version of Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (published at
http://google.com/covid19/mobility on April 2, 2020), a publicly available
resource intended to help public health authorities understand what has changed
in response to work-from-home, shelter-in-place, and other recommended policies
aimed at flattening the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our anonymization
process is designed to ensure that no personal data, including an individual's
location, movement, or contacts, can be derived from the resulting metrics.
  The high-level description of the procedure is as follows: we first generate
a set of anonymized metrics from the data of Google users who opted in to
Location History. Then, we compute percentage changes of these metrics from a
baseline based on the historical part of the anonymized metrics. We then
discard a subset which does not meet our bar for statistical reliability, and
release the rest publicly in a format that compares the result to the private
baseline.

    <title>Efficiency of Covid-19 Containment by Measuring Time Dependent Doubling
  Time</title>
    <summary>  While containment policies of the Covid-19 epidemic have been applied in
different countries, a comparative quantitative measure of the efficiency of
these policies is not available. We show here that the time evolution of the
pandemic doubling time Td(t) is a reliable measure of the efficiency of the
Lockdown, case Finding, mobile Tracing (LFT) policy using modern technologies
versus the traditional Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG) policy. This goal has been
achieved to verify by extracting the time evolution of the doubling time Td(t).
The results provide a quantitative measure and make possible predictions on the
time evolution of epidemic for different containment policy. Where the lowest s
factor, the characteristic time of the exponential growing Td(t) in the
arrested regime, was reached by LFT policy also the lowest number of deaths and
the shorter time width of the epidemic dome was reached. The record for the
largest number of deaths is correlated with the largest s factor in the near
threshold regime where no containment measures were taken in time. LFT policy
has been able to reduce both the intensity and time width of the Covid-19
pandemic dome achieving both a low number of deaths and low economic losses

    <title>Parametrization Model Motivated from Physical Processes for Studying the
  Spread of COVID-19 Epidemic</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of the new virus COVID-19, beyond the human health risks and
loss, has caused also very serious problems in a wide range of human
activities, including the basic and applied scientific research, mainly that
concern world wide collaborations. It is desirable to all of us to have the
prospect of quickly predicting a turning point in the daily cases curve of the
disease. In this work we face the problem of COVID-19 virus disease spreading
by aiming mostly to create a reliable mathematical model describing this
mechanism for an isolated society, for cities or even for a whole country.
Drawing upon similar mechanisms appearing in the particle detector Physics, we
concentrated to the so called, semi-gaussian function of n-degree. This
approach can provide some very useful advantages in the data analysis of the
daily reported cases of the infected people. Applying this model and fitting to
the data, reported until the submission of this work, we have determined, among
others, the mean infection time for a citizen in the society under study. We
also applied and adopted this model to the reported cases in other countries
and we have performed useful comparisons and conclusions.

    <title>Supply and demand shocks in the COVID-19 pandemic: An industry and
  occupation perspective</title>
    <summary>  We provide quantitative predictions of first order supply and demand shocks
for the U.S. economy associated with the COVID-19 pandemic at the level of
individual occupations and industries. To analyze the supply shock, we classify
industries as essential or non-essential and construct a Remote Labor Index,
which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Demand
shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic
developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID
period, these shocks would threaten around 22% of the US economy's GDP,
jeopardise 24% of jobs and reduce total wage income by 17%. At the industry
level, sectors such as transport are likely to have output constrained by
demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining and services are
more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants and
tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show
that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply and
demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We
should emphasize that our results are only first-order shocks -- we expect them
to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.

    <title>Real-Time Differential Epidemic Analysis and Prediction for COVID-19
  Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a new real-time differential virus transmission
model, which can give more accurate and robust short-term predictions of
COVID-19 transmitted infectious disease with benefits of near-term trend
projection. Different from the existing Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed
(SEIR) based virus transmission models, which fits well for pandemic modeling
with sufficient historical data, the new model, which is also SEIR based, uses
short history data to find the trend of the changing disease dynamics for the
infected, the dead and the recovered so that it can naturally accommodate the
adaptive real-time changes of disease mitigation, business activity and social
behavior of populations. As the parameters of the improved SEIR models are
trained by short history window data for accurate trend prediction, our
differential epidemic model, essentially are window-based time-varying SEIR
model. Since SEIR model still is a physics-based disease transmission model,
its near-term (like one month) projection can still be very instrumental for
policy makers to guide their decision for disease mitigation and business
activity policy change in a real-time. This is especially useful if the
pandemic lasts more than one year with different phases across the world like
1918 flu pandemic. Numerical results on the recent COVID-19 data from China,
Italy and US, California and New York states have been analyzed.

    <summary>  This work presents a simple and realistic approach to handle the available
data of COVID-19 patients in India and to forecast the scenario. The model
proposed is based on the available facts like the onset of lockdown (as
announced by the Government on 25th day, {\tau}0 and the recovery pattern
dictated by a mean life recovery time of {\tau}1 ( normally said to be around
14 days). The data of infected COVID-19 patients from March 2, to April 16,
2020 has been used to fit the evolution of infected, recovery and death counts.
A slow rising exponential growth, with R0 close to 1/6, is found to represent
the infected counts indicating almost a linear rise. The rest of growth,
saturation and decay of data is comprehensibly modelled by incorporating
lockdown time controlled R0, having a normal error function like behaviour
decaying to zero in some time frame of {\tau}2 . The recovery mean life time
{\tau}1 dictates the peak and decay. The results predicted for coming days are
interesting and optimistic. The introduced time constants based on experimental
data for both the recovery rate as well as for determining the time span of
activity of R0 after the lockdown are subject of debate and provide possibility
to introduce trigger factors to alter these to be more suited to the model. The
model can be extended to other communities with their own R0 and recovery time
parameters.

    <title>Estimación del número de reproducción de la epidemia COVID-19 en
  Culiacán Sinaloa, México</title>
    <summary>  Currently the COVID-19 epidemic is developing in the City of Culiac\'n
Sinaloa, Mexico, where up to April 20 of this year there have been 35 deaths
associated with this epidemic. The reproduction number $(R_0)$ of an epidemic
represents the average number of people infected by an infected person during
their period of infection. In this work we use the data published by the
Secretary of Health of the State of Sinaloa on the number of new infected cases
confirmed per day and we estimate that the value of $R_0$ is 1.562 with a 95%
confidence interval given by (1.401,1.742). We also estimate the mortality rate
among the confirmed cases, which turned out to be 16.8%.

    <title>COVID-19 publications: Database coverage, citations, readers, tweets,
  news, Facebook walls, Reddit posts</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic requires a fast response from researchers to help
address biological, medical and public health issues to minimize its impact. In
this rapidly evolving context, scholars, professionals and the public may need
to quickly identify important new studies. In response, this paper assesses the
coverage of scholarly databases and impact indicators during 21 March to 18
April 2020. The results confirm a rapid increase in the volume of research,
which particularly accessible through Google Scholar and Dimensions, and less
through Scopus, the Web of Science, PubMed. A few COVID-19 papers from the
21,395 in Dimensions were already highly cited, with substantial news and
social media attention. For this topic, in contrast to previous studies, there
seems to be a high degree of convergence between articles shared in the social
web and citation counts, at least in the short term. In particular, articles
that are extensively tweeted on the day first indexed are likely to be highly
read and relatively highly cited three weeks later. Researchers needing wide
scope literature searches (rather than health focused PubMed or medRxiv
searches) should start with Google Scholar or Dimensions and can use tweet and
Mendeley reader counts as indicators of likely importance.

    <title>A Critic Evaluation of Methods for COVID-19 Automatic Detection from
  X-Ray Images</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we compare and evaluate different testing protocols used for
automatic COVID-19 diagnosis from X-Ray images in the recent literature. We
show that similar results can be obtained using X-Ray images that do not
contain most of the lungs. We are able to remove the lungs from the images by
turning to black the center of the X-Ray scan and training our classifiers only
on the outer part of the images. Hence, we deduce that several testing
protocols for the recognition are not fair and that the neural networks are
learning patterns in the dataset that are not correlated to the presence of
COVID-19. Finally, we show that creating a fair testing protocol is a
challenging task, and we provide a method to measure how fair a specific
testing protocol is. In the future research we suggest to check the fairness of
a testing protocol using our tools and we encourage researchers to look for
better techniques than the ones that we propose.

    <title>A Light CNN for detecting COVID-19 from CT scans of the chest</title>
    <summary>  OVID-19 is a world-wide disease that has been declared as a pandemic by the
World Health Organization. Computer Tomography (CT) imaging of the chest seems
to be a valid diagnosis tool to detect COVID-19 promptly and to control the
spread of the disease. Deep Learning has been extensively used in medical
imaging and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been also used for
classification of CT images. We propose a light CNN design based on the model
of the SqueezeNet, for the efficient discrimination of COVID-19 CT images with
other CT images (community-acquired pneumonia and/or healthy images). On the
tested datasets, the proposed modified SqueezeNet CNN achieved 83.00\% of
accuracy, 85.00\% of sensitivity, 81.00\% of specificity, 81.73\% of precision
and 0.8333 of F1Score in a very efficient way (7.81 seconds medium-end laptot
without GPU acceleration). Besides performance, the average classification time
is very competitive with respect to more complex CNN designs, thus allowing its
usability also on medium power computers. In the next future we aim at
improving the performances of the method along two directions: 1) by increasing
the training dataset (as soon as other CT images will be available); 2) by
introducing an efficient pre-processing strategy.

    <title>Effect of Mitigation Measures on the Spreading of COVID-19 in Hard-Hit
  States</title>
    <summary>  State government-mandated social distancing measures have helped to slow down
the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Current predictive
models of the development of COVID-19, especially after mitigation efforts, are
largely based on extrapolating the data from other countries. Since most states
enforced stay-at-home orders towards the end of March, their effect should be
reflected in the death and infection counts at the end of April. Using the data
available until April 25th, we investigate the change in the infection rate due
to the mitigation efforts, and project death and infection counts until
September, 2020, for some of the most heavily impacted states: New York, New
Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois and Louisiana. We find that with the
current mitigation efforts five of those six states reduce their reproduction
number to a value less than one, stopping the exponential growth of the
pandemic. We also projected different scenarios after the mitigation is
relaxed. Analysis for other states can be found at
https://covid19projection.org/.

    <title>Integrated Time Series Summarization and Prediction Algorithm and its
  Application to COVID-19 Data Mining</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a simple method to extract from a set of multiple related
time series a compressed representation for each time series based on
statistics for the entire set of all time series. This is achieved by a
hierarchical algorithm that first generates an alphabet of shapelets based on
the segmentation of centroids for clustered data, before labels of these
shapelets are assigned to the segmentation of each single time series via
nearest neighbor search using unconstrained dynamic time warping as distance
measure to deal with non-uniform time series lenghts. Thereby, a sequence of
labels is assigned for each time series. Completion of the last label sequence
permits prediction of individual time series. Proposed method is evaluated on
two global COVID-19 datasets, first, for the number of daily net cases (daily
new infections minus daily recoveries), and, second, for the number of daily
deaths attributed to COVID-19 as of April 27, 2020. The first dataset involves
249 time series for different countries, each of length 96. The second dataset
involves 264 time series, each of length 96. Based on detected anomalies in
available data a decentralized exit strategy from lockdowns is advocated.

    <title>Human Mobility Trends during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States</title>
    <summary>  In March of this year, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and it continues to
threaten public health. This global health crisis imposes limitations on daily
movements, which have deteriorated every sector in our society. Understanding
public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical interventions should
be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. We aim to provide
tangible evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day
variations across the U.S. Large-scale public mobility at an aggregated level
is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related
to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity as
well as the sociodemographic variations regarding the pandemic propagation and
the non-pharmaceutical interventions. All mobility metrics adapted capture
decreased public movements after the national emergency declaration. The
population staying home has increased in all states and becomes more stable
after the stay-at-home order with a smaller range of fluctuation. There exists
overall mobility heterogeneity between the income or population density groups.
The public had been taking active responses, voluntarily staying home more, to
the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home orders stabilize the
variations. The study suggests that the public mobility trends conform with the
government message urging to stay home. We anticipate our data-driven analysis
offers integrated perspectives and serves as evidence to raise public awareness
and, consequently, reinforce the importance of social distancing while
assisting policymakers.

    <title>Detection of Line Artefacts in Lung Ultrasound Images of COVID-19
  Patients via Non-Convex Regularization</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present a novel method for line artefacts quantification in
lung ultrasound (LUS) images of COVID-19 patients. We formulate this as a
non-convex regularisation problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchy-based
penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. We employ a simple local
maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known
clinical definitions of line artefacts. Despite being non-convex, the proposed
technique is guaranteed to convergence through our proposed Cauchy proximal
splitting (CPS) method and accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical
line artefacts in LUS images. In order to reduce the number of false and missed
detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is
performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line
identification method and show a considerable performance gain with 87%
correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients. In
addition, owing to its fast convergence, our proposed method is readily
applicable for processing LUS image sequences.

    <title>City-scale dark fiber DAS measurements of infrastructure use during the
  COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Throughout the recent COVID-19 pandemic when government officials around the
world ordered citizens to quarantine inside their homes, real-time measurements
about the use of roads, hospitals, grocery stores, and other public
infrastructure became vital to accurately forecast viral infection rates and
inform future government decisions. Although mobile phone locations provide
some information about community-level activity, dense distributed geophysical
sensing of ground motions across a city are more complete and also natively
anonymous. In this paper, we demonstrate how fiber-optic Distributed Acoustic
Sensing (DAS) connected to a telecommunication cable beneath Palo Alto, CA
captured seismic and geodetic signals produced by vehicles during the COVID-19
pandemic outbreak and subsequent quarantine. We utilize DAS strain measurements
of roadbed deformation caused by local cars and trucks in an automatic template
matching detection algorithm to count the number of vehicles traveling per day
over a two-month period around the timing of the San Francisco Bay Area
shelter-in-place order. Using a segment of the optical fiber near a major
grocery store on Sand Hill Road we find a 50% decrease in vehicle count
immediately following the order, but data from near Stanford Hospital showed a
far more subtle change due to on-going hospital activities. We compare the
information derived from DAS measurements to other quarantine response metrics
and find a strong correlation with the relative changes reported by Google and
Apple using mobile phone data.

  Sequentially Relaxing Restrictions by Age</title>
    <summary>  Strong social distancing restrictions have been crucial to controlling the
COVID-19 outbreak thus far, and the next question is when and how to relax
these restrictions. A sequential timing of relaxing restrictions across groups
is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously reduce health
risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to
mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations,
while also managing the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic
activity. The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential
release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can
lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all
individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of
minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is
important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model
allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies,
which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and
planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
future outbreaks.

    <title>COVID-19 pandemic control: balancing detection policy and lockdown
  intervention under ICU sustainability</title>
    <summary>  We consider here an extended SIR model, including several features of the
recent COVID-19 outbreak: in particular the infected and recovered individuals
can either be detected (+) or undetected (-) and we also integrate an intensive
care unit (ICU) capacity. Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis
of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both
lockdown and detection intervention levers. With parametric specification based
on literature on COVID-19, we investigate the sensitivities of various
quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle trade-off
between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with
the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as
an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong
lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a
short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long
period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to
normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal
scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is
released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures
with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on
detection of infectious and immune individuals. Whenever massive resources are
introduced to detect infected individuals, the pressure on social distancing
can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals reveals
to be more moderate.

    <title>A Compressed Sensing Approach to Group-testing for COVID-19 Detection</title>
    <summary>  We propose Tapestry, a novel approach to pooled testing with application to
COVID-19 testing with quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) that can
result in shorter testing time and conservation of reagents and testing kits.
Tapestry combines ideas from compressed sensing and combinatorial group testing
with a novel noise model for PCR. Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the
input is a quantitative readout from each test, and the output is a list of
viral loads for each sample. While other pooling techniques require a second
confirmatory assay, Tapestry obtains individual sample-level results in a
single round of testing. When testing $n$ samples with $t$ tests, as many as
$k= O(t / \log n)$ infected samples can be identified at clinically-acceptable
false positive and false negative rates. This makes Tapestry viable even at
prevalence rates as high as 10\%. Tapestry has been validated in simulations as
well as in wet lab experiments with oligomers. Clinical trials with Covid-19
samples are underway. An accompanying Android application Byom Smart Testing
which makes the Tapestry protocol straightforward to implement in testing
centres is available for free download.

    <title>The Distributional Short-Term Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis on Wages in
  the United States</title>
    <summary>  This paper uses Bureau of Labor Statistics employment and wage data to study
the distributional impact of the COVID-19 crisis on wages in the United States
by mid-April. It answers whether wages of lower-wage workers decreased more
than others', and to what extent. We find that the COVID-19 outbreak
exacerbates existing inequalities. Workers at the bottom quintile in mid-March
were three times more likely to be laid off by mid-April compared to
higher-wage workers. Weekly wages of workers at the bottom quintile decreased
by 6% on average between mid-February and mid-March and by 26% between
mid-March and mid-April. The average decrease for higher quintiles was less
than 1% between mid-February and mid-March and about 10% between mid-March and
mid-April. We also find that workers aged 16-24 were hit much harder than older
workers. Hispanic workers were also hurt more than other racial groups. Their
wages decreased by 2-3 percentage points more than other workers' between
mid-March and mid-April.

    <title>Observing Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic using Worldwide Network
  Cameras</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, leading to "lockdown" policies
and social distancing. The pandemic has profoundly changed the world.
Traditional methods for observing these historical events are difficult because
sending reporters to areas with many infected people can put the reporters'
lives in danger. New technologies are needed for safely observing responses to
these policies. This paper reports using thousands of network cameras deployed
worldwide for the purpose of witnessing activities in response to the policies.
The network cameras can continuously provide real-time visual data (image and
video) without human efforts. Thus, network cameras can be utilized to observe
activities without risking the lives of reporters. This paper describes a
project that uses network cameras to observe responses to governments' policies
during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to April in 2020). The project discovers
over 30,000 network cameras deployed in 110 countries. A set of computer tools
are created to collect visual data from network cameras continuously during the
pandemic. This paper describes the methods to discover network cameras on the
Internet, the methods to collect and manage data, and preliminary results of
data analysis. This project can be the foundation for observing the possible
"second wave" in fall 2020. The data may be used for post-pandemic analysis by
sociologists, public health experts, and meteorologists.

    <title>Spatial Heterogeneity Can Lead to Substantial Local Variations in
  COVID-19 Timing and Severity</title>
    <summary>  Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment
(SIR) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local
mixing. Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed
diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks,
most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the
probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on
simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 U.S cities, we conclude
that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local
pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales
mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local
outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the
presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with
those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand
illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with
substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without
distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who
are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can
appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and
compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential
for spatial network structure to generate highly non-uniform diffusion behavior
even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such
structure when designing models to inform healthcare planning, predict
community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.

    <title>BeepTrace: Blockchain-enabled Privacy-preserving Contact Tracing for
  COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has exposed an urgent need for effective
contact tracing solutions through mobile phone applications to prevent the
infection from spreading further. However, due to the nature of contact
tracing, public concern on privacy issues has been a bottleneck to the existing
solutions, which is significantly affecting the uptake of contact tracing
applications across the globe. In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled
privacy-preserving contact tracing scheme: BeepTrace, where we propose to adopt
blockchain bridging the user/patient and the authorized solvers to desensitize
the user ID and location information. Compared with recently proposed contract
tracing solutions, our approach shows higher security and privacy with the
additional advantages of being battery friendly and globally accessible.
Results show viability in terms of the required resource at both server and
mobile phone perspectives. Through breaking the privacy concerns of the public,
the proposed BeepTrace solution can provide a timely framework for authorities,
companies, software developers and researchers to fast develop and deploy
effective digital contact tracing applications, to conquer COVID-19 pandemic
soon. Meanwhile, the open initiative of BeepTrace allows worldwide
collaborations, integrate existing tracing and positioning solutions with the
help of blockchain technology.

    <title>Quantifying socioeconomic activities and weather effects on the global
  spread of COVID-19 epidemic</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 has caused more than three million infections and over two
hundred thousand deaths by April 20201. Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA)
is among the most adopted governmental mitigating efforts to combat the
transmission of the virus, though the degree varies dramatically among
different regimes2. This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA
and weather conditions to the transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling
out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control
policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects3,4, we show that the
limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by
18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and
wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a
non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed
countries5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather
effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors
most of the time with a controlled climate. We finally estimate the reduced
reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to
restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe
respectively. From late January to mid-April, all regions, except for China,
Australia, and south Korea show a steep upward trend of spared infections due
to restricting SA. US and Europe, in particular, show far steeper upward trends
of spared infections in the analyzed timeframe, signaling a greater risk of
reopening the economy too soon.

    <title>CovidNet: To Bring Data Transparency in the Era of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Timely, creditable, and fine-granular case information is vital for local
communities and individual citizens to make rational and data-driven responses
to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents CovidNet, a COVID-19 tracking
project associated with a large scale epidemic dataset, which was initiated by
1Point3Acres. To the best of our knowledge, the project is the only platform
providing real-time global case information of more than 4,124 sub-divisions
from over 27 countries worldwide with multi-language supports. The platform
also offers interactive visualization tools to analyze the full historical case
curves in each region. Initially launched as a voluntary project to bridge the
data transparency gap in North America in January 2020, this project by far has
become one of the major independent sources worldwide and has been consumed by
many other tracking platforms. The accuracy and freshness of the dataset is a
result of the painstaking efforts from our voluntary teamwork, crowd-sourcing
channels, and automated data pipelines. As of May 18, 2020, the project website
has been visited more than 200 million times and the CovidNet dataset has
empowered over 522 institutions and organizations worldwide in policy-making
and academic researches. All datasets are openly accessible for non-commercial
purposes at https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com via a formal request through
our APIs.

    <title>From Prediction to Prescription: AI-Based Optimization of
  Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Several models have been developed to predict how the COVID-19 pandemic
spreads, and how it could be contained with non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) such as social distancing restrictions and school and business closures.
This paper demonstrates how evolutionary AI could be used to facilitate the
next step, i.e. determining most effective intervention strategies
automatically. Through evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription (ESP), it
is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate
them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for
different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic
and the need to minimize their economic impact. While still limited by
available data, early experiments suggest that workplace and school
restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. It also
demonstrates that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and
suggests creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g. by
alternating them over time. As more data becomes available, the approach can be
increasingly useful in dealing with COVID-19 as well as possible future
pandemics.

    <title>How the asymptomatic population is influencing the COVID-19 outbreak in
  India?</title>
    <summary>  According to the current perception, symptomatic, presymptomatic, and
asymptomatic infectious persons can infect the healthy population susceptible
to the SARS-Cov-2. More importantly, various reports indicate that the number
of asymptomatic cases can be several-fold higher than the reported symptomatic
cases. In this article, we take the reported cases in India and various states
within the country as the specimen to understand the progression of the
COVID-19. Employing a modified SEIRD model, we predict the spread of COVID-19
by the symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infectious population. Considering
reported infection primarily due to symptomatic we compare the model predicted
results with the available data to estimate the dynamics of the
asymptomatically infected population. Our data indicate that in the absence of
the asymptomatic infectious population, the number of symptomatic cases would
have been much less. Therefore, the current progress of the symptomatic
infection can be reduced by quarantining the asymptomatically infectious
population via extensive or random testing. This study is motivated strictly
towards academic pursuit; this theoretical investigation is not meant for
influencing policy decisions or public health practices.

    <title>End-to-end learning for semiquantitative rating of COVID-19 severity on
  Chest X-rays</title>
    <summary>  In this work we designed an end-to-end deep learning architecture for
predicting, on Chest X-rays images (CRX), a multi-regional score conveying the
degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 patients. Such semiquantitative scoring
system, namely Brixia-score, was applied in serial monitoring of such patients,
showing significant prognostic value, in one of the hospitals that experienced
one of the highest pandemic peaks in Italy. To solve such a challenging visual
task, we adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy structured to handle
different tasks (segmentation, spatial alignment, and score estimation) trained
with a "from part to whole" procedure involving different datasets. In
particular, we exploited a clinical dataset of almost 5,000 CXR annotated
images collected in the same hospital. Our BS-Net demonstrated self-attentive
behavior and a high degree of accuracy in all processing stages. Through
inter-rater agreement tests and a gold standard comparison, we were able to
show that our solution outperforms single human annotators in rating accuracy
and consistency, thus supporting the possibility of using this tool in contexts
of computer-assisted monitoring. Highly resolved (super-pixel level)
explainability maps were also generated, with an original technique, to
visually help the understanding of the network activity on the lung areas. We
eventually tested the performance robustness of our model on a variegated
public COVID-19 dataset, for which we also provide Brixia-score annotations,
observing good direct generalization and fine-tuning capabilities that
favorably highlight the portability of BS-Net in other clinical settings.

    <title>Evaluation of the number of COVID-19 undiagnosed infected using source
  of infection measurements</title>
    <summary>  Multiple studies have been conducted to predict the impact and duration of
the current COVID-19 epidemics. Most of those studies rely on parameter
calibration using the published number of confirmed cases. Unfortunately, this
number is usually incomplete and biased due to the lack of testing capacities,
and varying testing protocols. An essential requirement for better monitoring
is the evaluation of the number of undiagnosed infected individuals. This
number is crucial for the determination of transmission prevention strategies
and it provides statistics on the epidemic dynamics. To estimate the number of
undiagnosed infected individuals, we studied the relation between the fraction
of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with
known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We simulated multiple models
currently used to study the COVID-19 pandemic and computed the relation between
these two fractions in all those models. Across most models currently used and
for most realistic model parameters, the relation between the two fractions is
consistently linear and model independent. This relation can be used to
estimate the number of undiagnosed infected, with no explicit epidemiological
model. We apply this method to measure the number of undiagnosed infected in
Israel. Since the fraction of confirmed cases with a known source can be
obtained from epidemiological investigations in any country, one can estimate
the total number of infected individuals in the same country.

    <title>Rethinking Case Fatality Ratios for COVID-19 from a data-driven
  viewpoint</title>
    <summary>  The case fatality ratio (CFR) for COVID-19 is difficult to estimate. One
difficulty is due to ignoring or overestimating time delay between reporting
and death. We claim that all of these cause large errors and artificial time
dependence of the CFR. We find that for each country, there is a unique value
of the time lag between reported cases and deaths versus time, that yields the
optimal correlation between them is a specific sense. We find that the
resulting corrected CFR (deaths shifted back by this time lag, divided by
cases) is actually constant over many months, for many countries, but also for
the entire world. This optimal time lag and constant CFR for each country can
be found through a simple data driven algorithm. The traditional CFR (ignoring
time lag) is spuriously time-dependent and its evolution is hard to quantify.
Our corrected CFR is constant over time, therefore an important index of the
pandemic in each country, and can be inferred from data earlier on,
facilitating improved early estimates of COVID-19 mortality.

    <title>The Limits to Learning an SIR Process: Granular Forecasting for Covid-19</title>
    <summary>  A multitude of forecasting efforts have arisen to support management of the
ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. These efforts typically rely on a variant of the SIR
process and have illustrated that building effective forecasts for an epidemic
in its early stages is challenging. This is perhaps surprising since these
models rely on a small number of parameters and typically provide an excellent
retrospective fit to the evolution of a disease. So motivated, we provide an
analysis of the limits to estimating an SIR process. We show that no unbiased
estimator can hope to learn this process until observing enough of the epidemic
so that one is approximately two-thirds of the way to reaching the peak for new
infections. Our analysis provides insight into a regularization strategy that
permits effective learning across simultaneously and asynchronously evolving
epidemics. This strategy has been used to produce accurate, granular
predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic that has found large-scale practical
application in a large US state.

    <title>From Bad to Worse: Airline Boarding Changes in Response to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Airlines have introduced a back-to-front boarding process in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. It is motivated by the desire to reduce passengers'
likelihood of passing close to seated passengers when they take their seats.
However, our prior work on the risk of Ebola spread in airplanes suggested that
the driving force for increased exposure to infection transmission risk is the
clustering of passengers while waiting for others to stow their luggage and
take their seats. In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes
lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the
reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding
processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using
pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show
that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared
with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a
typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping
middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show
that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this
case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises
from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated. Our
results suggest that airlines either revert to their earlier boarding process
or adopt the better random process.

    <title>Exploratory Analysis of a Social Media Network in Sri Lanka during the
  COVID-19 Virus Outbreak</title>
    <summary>  During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple aspects of human life were subjected
to unprecedented changes, globally. In Sri Lanka, a developing country located
in South Asia, it was possible to observe a range of events that arose due to
the influence of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. Thus, the people of Sri Lanka
used Social Media to voice their opinions regarding such events and those
involved in them, enabling the ideal avenue to explore the social perception.
However, the outcome of such actions was at certain times detrimental. This
study was conducted as an attempt to identify the reasons for such instances as
well as to identify the behaviours of the Sri Lankan populace during such a
crisis event. To support this study, observations, as well as data of related
posts from a sample of 50 sources, were manually collected from the most
popular social media platform in Sri Lanka, Facebook. The posts considered
spanned until approximately a month after the initial major virus outbreak in
the country and contained content that even vaguely related to the virus.
Utilising such data, various forms of analyses such as topic significance and
topic co-occurrences were conducted. The findings highlight, while there can be
social detrimental ideas shared, the majority of the posts point constructive
and positive thoughts suggesting the successful influence from the cultural and
social values Sri Lanka society promotes throughout.

    <title>V-, U-, L-, or W-shaped recovery after COVID? Insights from an Agent
  Based Model</title>
    <summary>  We discuss the impact of a Covid-like shock on a simple toy economy,
described by the Mark-0 Agent-Based Model that we developed and discussed in a
series of previous papers. We consider a mixed supply and demand shock, and
show that depending on the shock parameters (amplitude and duration), our toy
economy can display V-shaped, U-shaped or W-shaped recoveries, and even an
L-shaped output curve with permanent output loss. This is due to the existence
of a self-sustained "bad" state of the economy. We then discuss two policies
that attempt to moderate the impact of the shock: giving easy credit to firms,
and the so-called helicopter money, i.e. injecting new money into the
households savings. We find that both policies are effective if strong enough,
and we highlight the potential danger of terminating these policies too early.
While we only discuss a limited number of scenarios, our model is flexible and
versatile enough to allow for a much wider exploration, thus serving as a
useful tool for the qualitative understanding of post-Covid recovery.

    <title>Network model and analysis of the spread of Covid-19 with social
  distancing</title>
    <summary>  The first mitigation response to the Covid-19 pandemic was to limit
person-to-person interaction as much as possible. This was implemented by the
temporary closing of many workplaces and people were required to follow social
distancing. Networks are a great way to represent interactions among people and
the temporary severing of these interactions. Here, we present a network model
of human-human interactions that could be mediators of disease spread. The
nodes of this network are individuals and different types of edges denote
family cliques, workplace interactions, interactions arising from essential
needs, and social interactions. Each individual can be in one of four states:
susceptible, infected, immune, and dead. The network and the disease parameters
are informed by the existing literature on Covid-19. Using this model, we
simulate the spread of an infectious disease in the presence of various
mitigation scenarios. For example, lockdown is implemented by deleting edges
that denote non-essential interactions. We validate the simulation results with
the real data by matching the basic and effective reproduction numbers during
different phases of the spread. We also simulate different possibilities of the
slow lifting of the lockdown by varying the transmission rate as facilities are
slowly opened but people follow prevention measures like wearing masks etc. We
make predictions on the probability and intensity of a second wave of infection
in each of these scenarios.

    <title>The overall mortality caused by COVID-19 in the European region is
  highly associated with demographic composition: A spatial regression-based
  approach</title>
    <summary>  The demographic factors have a substantial impact on the overall casualties
caused by the COVID-19. In this study, the spatial association between the key
demographic variables and COVID-19 cases and deaths were analyzed using the
spatial regression models. Total 13 (for COVID-19 case factor) and 8 (for
COVID-19 death factor) key variables were considered for the modelling. Total
five spatial regression models such as Geographically weighted regression
(GWR), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error_Lag
model (SEM_SLM), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) were performed for the spatial
modelling and mapping of model estimates. The local R2 values, which suggesting
the influences of the selected demographic variables on overall casualties
caused by COVID-19, was found highest in Italy and the UK. The moderate local
R2 was observed for France, Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The lowest local R2 value for COVID-19
cases was accounted for Latvia and Lithuania. Among the 13 variables, the
highest local R2 was calculated for total population (R2 = 0.92), followed by
death crude death rate (R2 = 0.9), long time illness (R2 = 0.84), population
with age &gt;80 (R2 = 0.59), employment (R2 = 0.46), life expectancy at 65 (R2 =
0.34), crude birth rate (R2 = 0.31), life expectancy (R2 = 0.31), Population
with age 65-80 (R2 = 0.29), Population with age 15-24 (R2 = 0.27), Population
with age 25-49 (R2 = 0.27), Population with age 0-14 (R2 = 0.23), and
Population with age 50-65 (R2 = 0.23), respectively.

    <title>Insights from early mathematical models of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory
  disease (COVID-19) dynamics</title>
    <summary>  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified to
cause acute respiratory disease in humans. An outbreak of this disease has been
reported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter.
The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the
Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February
2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary
mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here,
the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as
inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based
strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such
as during large social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the
exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. With a basic
reproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected
person staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people.
Assuming the exposure time is 18 hours, the model recommends that attendees of
the social gathering should have a protection with more than 70 percent
effectiveness.

    <title>Simulation of Covid-19 epidemic evolution: are compartmental models
  really predictive?</title>
    <summary>  Computational models for the simulation of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic evolution would be extremely
useful to support authorities in designing healthcare policies and lockdown
measures to contain its impact on public health and economy. In Italy, the
devised forecasts have been mostly based on a pure data-driven approach, by
fitting and extrapolating open data on the epidemic evolution collected by the
Italian Civil Protection Center. In this respect, SIR epidemiological models,
which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between
population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand
and predict the collective emergent response. The present contribution
addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model,
suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be
able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a
machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is
proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set
of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case
study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model
predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training,
and that further data are still required to achieve convergent -- and therefore
reliable -- predictions.

    <title>Modelling strong control measures for epidemic propagation with networks
  -- A COVID-19 case study</title>
    <summary>  We show that precise knowledge of epidemic transmission parameters is not
required to build an informative model of the spread of disease. We propose a
detailed model of the topology of the contact network under various external
control regimes and demonstrate that this is sufficient to capture the salient
dynamical characteristics and to inform decisions. Contact between individuals
in the community is characterised by a contact graph, the structure of that
contact graph is selected to mimic community control measures. Our model of
city-level transmission of an infectious agent (SEIR model) characterises
spread via a (a) scale-free contact network (no control); (b) a random graph
(elimination of mass gatherings); and (c) small world lattice (partial to full
lockdown -- "social" distancing). This model exhibits good qualitative
agreement between simulation and data from the 2020 pandemic spread of
coronavirus. Estimates of the relevant rate parameters of the SEIR model are
obtained and we demonstrate the robustness of our model predictions under
uncertainty of those estimates. The social context and utility of this work is
identified, contributing to a highly effective pandemic response in Western
Australia.

    <title>Fractional-order susceptible-infected model: definition and applications
  to the study of COVID-19 main protease</title>
    <summary>  We propose a model for the transmission of perturbations across the amino
acids of a protein represented as an interaction network. The dynamics consists
of a Susceptible-Infected (SI) model based on the Caputo fractional-order
derivative. We find an upper bound to the analytical solution of this model
which represents the worse-case scenario on the propagation of perturbations
across a protein residue network. This upper bound is expressed in terms of
Mittag-Leffler functions of the adjacency matrix of the network of inter-amino
acids interactions. We then apply this model to the analysis of the propagation
of perturbations produced by inhibitors of the main protease of SARS CoV-2. We
find that the perturbations produced by strong inhibitors of the protease are
propagated far away from the binding site, confirming the long-range nature of
intra-protein communication. On the contrary, the weakest inhibitors only
transmit their perturbations across a close environment around the binding
site. These findings may help to the design of drug candidates against this new
coronavirus.

    <title>Pandemic Programming: How COVID-19 affects software developers and how
  their organizations can help</title>
    <summary>  Context. As a novel coronavirus swept the world in early 2020, thousands of
software developers began working from home. Many did so on short notice, under
difficult and stressful conditions. Objective. This paper seeks to understand
the effects of the pandemic on developers' wellbeing and productivity. Method.
A questionnaire survey was created mainly from existing, validated scales. The
questionnaire ran in 12 languages, with region-specific advertising strategies.
The data was analyzed using non-parametric inferential statistics and
structural equation modeling. Results. The questionnaire received 2225 usable
responses from 53 countries. Factor analysis supported the validity of the
scales and the structural model achieved a good fit (CFI = 0.961, RMSEA =
0.051, SRMR = 0.067). Findings include: (1) developers' wellbeing and
productivity are suffering; (2) productivity and wellbeing are closely related;
(3) disaster preparedness, fear related to the pandemic and home office
ergonomics all affect wellbeing or productivity; (4) women, parents and people
with disabilities may be disproportionately affected. Conclusions. To improve
employee productivity, software companies should focus on maximizing employee
wellbeing and improving the ergonomics of employees' home offices. Women,
parents and disabled persons may require extra support.

    <title>A numerical simulation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Argentina using the
  SEIR model</title>
    <summary>  A pandemic caused by a new coronavirus has spread worldwide, causing an
epidemic in Argentina. We implement an SEIR model to analyze the evolution of
the disease in Buenos Aires and neighbouring cities (RMBA) with 15 million
inhabitants. The parameters of the model are calibrated by using as data the
number of casualties officially reported. Since infinite solutions honour the
data, we show a set of cases by considering different situations. The first set
of parameters yields initially a reproduction ratio R0 = 3.33 decreasing to
0.95 in April 8, after the lockdown, but increasing to 1.55 after April 27,
most probably due to an increase of the contagion in highly populated slums.
The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 1.88 % and the predicted number of
casualties is 173000 deaths with 9 million people infected at the end of the
epidemic. However, keeping $R_0$ = 0.95 after April 27, would cause only 1881
casualties and 92955 infected individuals. Other cases, assuming the present
trend, predict smaller incubation periods (4-5 days) and yield between 20000
and 70000 deaths and IFRs between 0.5 % and 1.1 %. We also consider doubling
the number of casualties, with a death toll of 44000 individuals and 5.1
million infected individuals. Other choices of parameters also provide a good
fit of the data, indicating the uncertainty of the results, which may differ
from reported values. The analysis allows us to study how isolation and social
distancing measures affect the time evolution of the epidemic.

    <title>COVID-19 Related Mobility Reduction: Heterogenous Effects on Sleep and
  Physical Activity Rhythms</title>
    <summary>  Mobility restrictions imposed to suppress coronavirus transmission can alter
physical activity (PA) and sleep patterns. Characterization of response
heterogeneity and their underlying reasons may assist in tailoring customized
interventions. We obtained wearable data covering baseline, incremental
movement restriction and lockdown periods from 1824 city-dwelling, working
adults aged 21 to 40 years, incorporating 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038
days of PA. Four distinct rest activity rhythms (RARs) were identified using
k-means clustering of participants' temporally distributed step counts.
Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of time spent in each of these RAR
revealed 4 groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and
during the lockdown. Substantial but asymmetric delays in bedtime and waketime
resulted in a 24 min increase in weekday sleep duration with no loss in sleep
efficiency. Resting heart rate declined 2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 38%. 4
groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were
better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown.
The least active group comprising 51 percent of the sample, were younger and
predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the
greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend
differences. Among different mobility restrictions, removal of habitual social
cues by lockdown had the largest effect on PA and sleep. Sleep and resting
heart rate unexpectedly improved. RAR evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of
responses to lockdown and can identify characteristics of persons at risk of
decline in health and wellbeing.

    <title>The Reconstruction and Prediction Algorithm of the Fractional TDD for
  the Local Outbreak of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  From late December, 2019, the novel Corona-Virus began to spread in the
mainland of China. For predicting the trend of the Corona Virus spread, several
time delay dynamic systems (TDD) are proposed. In this paper, we establish a
novel fractional time delay dynamic system (FTDD) to describe the local
outbreak of COVID-19. The fractional derivative is introduced to account for
the sub-diffusion process of the confirmed and cured peoples growth. Based on
the public health data by the government, we propose a stable reconstruction
algorithm of the coefficients. The reconstructed coefficients are used to
predict the trend of the Corona-Virus. The numerical results are in good
agreement with the public data.

    <title>Can the COVID-19 epidemic be controlled on the basis of daily test
  reports?</title>
    <summary>  This paper studies if and to which extent COVID-19 epidemics can be
controlled by authorities taking decisions on public health measures on the
basis of daily reports of swab test results, active cases and total cases. A
suitably simplified process model is derived to support the controllability
analysis, highlighting the presence of very significant time delay; the model
is validated with data from several outbreaks. The analysis shows that
suppression strategies can be effective if strong enough and enacted early on.
It also shows how mitigation strategies can fail because of the combination of
delay, unstable dynamics, and uncertainty in the feedback loop; approximate
conditions based on the theory of limitation of linear control are given for
feedback control to be feasible.

    <title>Covid-19 spread: Reproduction of data and prediction using a SIR model
  on Euclidean network</title>
    <summary>  We study the datafor the cumulative as well as daily number of cases in the
Covid-19 outbreak in China. The cumulative data can be fit to an empirical form
obtained from a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model studied on an
Euclidean network previously. Plotting the number of cases against the distance
from the epicenter for both China and Italy, we find an approximate power law
variation with an exponent $\sim 1.85$ showing strongly that the spatial
dependence plays a key role, a factor included in the model. We report here
that the SIR model on the Eucledean network can reproduce with a high accuracy
the data for China for given parameter values, and can also predict when the
epidemic, at least locally, can be expected to be over.

    <title>Machine Learning the Phenomenology of COVID-19 From Early Infection
  Dynamics</title>
    <summary>  We present a robust data-driven machine learning analysis of the COVID-19
pandemic from its early infection dynamics, specifically infection counts over
time. The goal is to extract actionable public health insights. These insights
include the infectious force, the rate of a mild infection becoming serious,
estimates for asymtomatic infections and predictions of new infections over
time. We focus on USA data starting from the first confirmed infection on
January 20 2020. Our methods reveal significant asymptomatic (hidden)
infection, a lag of about 10 days, and we quantitatively confirm that the
infectious force is strong with about a 0.14% transition from mild to serious
infection. Our methods are efficient, robust and general, being agnostic to the
specific virus and applicable to different populations or cohorts.

    <title>Network structure of COVID-19 spread and the lacuna in India's testing
  strategy</title>
    <summary>  We characterize the network of COVID-19 spread in India and find that the
transmission rate is 0.43, with daily case growth driven by individuals who
contracted the virus abroad. We explore the question of whether this represents
exponentially decaying dynamics or is simply an artefact of India's testing
strategy. Testing has largely been limited to individuals travelling from
high-risk countries and their immediate contacts, meaning that the network
reflects positive identifications from a biased testing sample. Given generally
low levels of testing and an almost complete absence of testing for community
spread, there is significant risk that we may be missing out on the actual
nature of outbreak. India still has an apparently low current caseload, with
possibly a small window of time to act, and should therefore aggressively and
systematically expand random testing for community spread, including for
asymptomatic cases. This will help understand true transmission characteristics
and plan appropriately for the immediate future.

    <title>Logistic approximations used to describe new outbreaks in the 2020
  COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  In this investigation I used the Logistic Model to fit the COVID-19 pandemic
data for some countries. The data modeled is the death numbers per day in
China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Spain and United States. Considering the
current growth rate of the pandemic, it was possible to show that the death
toll should be between 3,277-3,327 deaths in China, 2,035-2,107 in Iran,
120-134 in South Korea, 11,227-12,793 in Italy and 6,217-7,405 in Spain. Also,
with this toy model it was possible to show a clear emergence of a new outbreak
within the same country (Iran, China and the United States). The growth rate of
deaths found for South Korea was the lowest among the countries studied
($0.14701\pm0.00923$) and for China ($0.16667\pm0.00284$). Italy
($0.22594\pm0.00599$) and Spain ($0.31213\pm0.02337$) had the highest rates and
in the second wave in Iran ($0.37893\pm0.02712$).

    <title>Adjoint-based Data Assimilation of an Epidemiology Model for the
  Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020</title>
    <summary>  Data assimilation is used to optimally fit a classical epidemiology model to
the Johns Hopkins data of the Covid-19 pandemic. The optimisation is based on
the confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. This is the only data available with
reasonable accuracy. Infection and recovery rates can be infered from the model
as well as the model parameters. The parameters can be linked with government
actions or events like the end of the holiday season. Based on this numbers
predictions for the future can be made and control targets specified. With
other words: We look for a solution to a given model which fits the given data
in an optimal sense. Having that solution, we have all parameters.

    <title>Solvable delay model for epidemic spreading: the case of Covid-19 in
  Italy</title>
    <summary>  We present a simple but realistic model for describing the diffusion of an
infectious disease on a population of individuals. The dynamics is governed by
a single functional delay differential equation, which, in the case of a large
population, can be solved exactly, even in the presence of a time-dependent
infection rate. This delay model has a higher degree of accuracy than that of
the so-called SIR model, commonly used in epidemiology, which, instead, is
formulated in terms of a set of three ordinary differential equations. We apply
our model to describe the outbreak of the new virus COVID-19 in Italy, taking
into account the containment measures implemented by the government in order to
mitigate the spreading of the virus and the social costs for the population.

    <title>Parametric analysis of early data on COVID-19 expansion in selected
  European countries</title>
    <summary>  We analyze the early data on COVID-19 expansion in selected European
countries using an analytical parametric model. A description of the time
dependence of the disease expansion and a method to evaluate trends of the
expansion are proposed. Several features are observed in the data, namely a
high predictability of the expansion of disease in Italy and a convergence of
the "pushback" parameter towards a limiting value in all the countries where
restrictive measures have been adopted. Basic predictions for the evolution of
the disease expansion are made for selected countries with a stable evolution
in the parametric space of the model. The findings presented here should
contribute to the understanding of the behavior of the disease expansion and
the role of the restrictive measures on the evolution of the expansion.

    <title>A Modified SIR Model for the COVID-19 Contagion in Italy</title>
    <summary>  The purpose of this work is to give a contribution to the understanding of
the COVID-19 contagion in Italy. To this end, we developed a modified
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for the contagion, and we used
official data of the pandemic up to March 30th, 2020 for identifying the
parameters of this model. The non standard part of our approach resides in the
fact that we considered as model parameters also the initial number of
susceptible individuals, as well as the proportionality factor relating the
detected number of positives with the actual (and unknown) number of infected
individuals. Identifying the contagion, recovery and death rates as well as the
mentioned parameters amounts to a non-convex identification problem that we
solved by means of a two-dimensional grid search in the outer loop, with a
standard weighted least-squares optimization problem as the inner step.

    <title>COVID-19 Outbreak in Pakistan: Model-Driven Impact Analysis and
  Guidelines</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the rapid spread of COVID-19 all across the globe, we have
performed simulations of a system dynamic epidemic spread model in different
possible situations. The simulation, not only captures the model dynamic of the
spread of the virus, but also, takes care of population and mobility data. The
model is calibrated based on epidemic data and events specifically of Pakistan,
which can easily be generalized. The simulation results are quite disturbing,
indicating that, even with stringent social distancing and testing strategies
and for a quite long time (even beyond one year), the spread would be
significant (in tens of thousands). The real alarm is when some of these
measures got leaked for a short time within this duration, which may result in
catastrophic situation when millions of people would be infected.

    <title>Visualising the Evolution of English Covid-19 Cases with Topological
  Data Analysis Ball Mapper</title>
    <summary>  Understanding disease spread through data visualisation has concentrated on
trends and maps. Whilst these are helpful, they neglect important
multi-dimensional interactions between characteristics of communities. Using
the Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper algorithm we construct an abstract
representation of NUTS3 level economic data, overlaying onto it the confirmed
cases of Covid-19 in England. In so doing we may understand how the disease
spreads on different socio-economical dimensions. It is observed that some
areas of the characteristic space have quickly raced to the highest levels of
infection, while others close by in the characteristic space, do not show large
infection growth. Likewise, we see patterns emerging in very different areas
that command more monitoring. A strong contribution for Topological Data
Analysis, and the Ball Mapper algorithm especially, in comprehending dynamic
epidemic data is signposted.

    <title>Inexpensive Domain Adaptation of Pretrained Language Models: Case
  Studies on Biomedical NER and Covid-19 QA</title>
    <summary>  Domain adaptation of Pretrained Language Models (PTLMs) is typically achieved
by unsupervised pretraining on target-domain text. While successful, this
approach is expensive in terms of hardware, runtime and CO_2 emissions. Here,
we propose a cheaper alternative: We train Word2Vec on target-domain text and
align the resulting word vectors with the wordpiece vectors of a general-domain
PTLM. We evaluate on eight biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks and
compare against the recently proposed BioBERT model. We cover over 50% of the
BioBERT-BERT F1 delta, at 5% of BioBERT's CO_2 footprint and 2% of its cloud
compute cost. We also show how to quickly adapt an existing general-domain
Question Answering (QA) model to an emerging domain: the Covid-19 pandemic.

    <title>The COVID-19 pandemic: growth patterns, power law scaling, and
  saturation</title>
    <summary>  More and more countries show a significant slowdown in the number of new
COVID-19 infections due to effective governmentally instituted lockdown and
social distancing measures. We have analyzed the growth behavior of the top 25
most affected countries by means of a local slope analysis and found three
distinct patterns that individual countries follow depending on the strictness
of the lockdown protocols: exponential rise and fall, power law, or logistic.
For countries showing power law growth we have determined the scaling
exponents. For countries that showed a strong slowdown in the rate of
infections we have extrapolated the expected saturation of the number of
infections and the expected final date. Two different extrapolation methods
(logistic and parabolic) were used. Both methods agree on the order of
magnitude of saturation and end dates. Global infections rates are analyzed
with the same methods. The relevance and accuracy of these extrapolations is
discussed.

    <title>How to Best Predict the Daily Number of New Infections of Covid-19</title>
    <summary>  Knowledge about the daily number of new infections of Covid-19 is important
because it is the basis for political decisions resulting in lockdowns and
urgent health care measures. We use Germany as an example to illustrate
shortcomings of official numbers, which are, at least in Germany, disclosed
only with several days of delay and severely underreported on weekends (more
than 40%). These shortcomings outline an urgent need for alternative data
sources. The other widely cited source provided by the Center for Systems
Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) also deviates for
Germany on average by 79% from the official numbers. We argue that Google
Search and Twitter data should complement official numbers. They predict even
better than the original values from Johns Hopkins University and do so several
days ahead. These two data sources could also be used in parts of the world
where official numbers do not exist or are perceived to be unreliable.

    <title>Assessing the risks of "infodemics" in response to COVID-19 epidemics</title>
    <summary>  Our society is built on a complex web of interdependencies whose effects
become manifest during extraordinary events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, with
shocks in one system propagating to the others to an exceptional extent. We
analyzed more than 100 millions Twitter messages posted worldwide in 64
languages during the epidemic emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 and classified the
reliability of news diffused. We found that waves of unreliable and low-quality
information anticipate the epidemic ones, exposing entire countries to
irrational social behavior and serious threats for public health. When the
epidemics hit the same area, reliable information is quickly inoculated, like
antibodies, and the system shifts focus towards certified informational
sources. Contrary to mainstream beliefs, we show that human response to
falsehood exhibits early-warning signals that might be mitigated with adequate
communication strategies.

    <title>The challenges of modeling and forecasting the spread of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We present three data driven model-types for COVID-19 with a minimal number
of parameters to provide insights into the spread of the disease that may be
used for developing policy responses. The first is exponential growth, widely
studied in analysis of early-time data. The second is a self-exciting branching
process model which includes a delay in transmission and recovery. It allows
for meaningful fit to early time stochastic data. The third is the well-known
Susceptible-Infected-Resistant (SIR) model and its cousin, SEIR, with an
"Exposed" component. All three models are related quantitatively, and the SIR
model is used to illustrate the potential effects of short-term distancing
measures in the United States.

    <title>Estimating the COVID-19 Infection Rate: Anatomy of an Inference Problem</title>
    <summary>  As a consequence of missing data on tests for infection and imperfect
accuracy of tests, reported rates of population infection by the SARS CoV-2
virus are lower than actual rates of infection. Hence, reported rates of severe
illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding
the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of
bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper
explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative
findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data
with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the
accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context. We find that
the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find
that the infection fatality rate in Italy is substantially lower than reported.

    <title>Social network-based distancing strategies to flatten the COVID 19 curve
  in a post-lockdown world</title>
    <summary>  Social distancing and isolation have been introduced widely to counter the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, more moderate contact reduction policies become
desirable owing to adverse social, psychological, and economic consequences of
a complete or near-complete lockdown. Adopting a social network approach, we
evaluate the effectiveness of three targeted distancing strategies designed to
'keep the curve flat' and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are
limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts, seeking similarity across
contacts, and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate
stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection
models, ideal-type social network models, and statistical relational event
models. We demonstrate that strategic reduction of contact can strongly
increase the efficiency of social distancing measures, introducing the
possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low. This
approach provides nuanced insights to policy makers for effective social
distancing that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.

    <title>SIRNet: Understanding Social Distancing Measures with Hybrid Neural
  Network Model for COVID-19 Infectious Spread</title>
    <summary>  The SARS-CoV-2 infectious outbreak has rapidly spread across the globe and
precipitated varying policies to effectuate physical distancing to ameliorate
its impact. In this study, we propose a new hybrid machine learning model,
SIRNet, for forecasting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic that couples with
the epidemiological models. We use categorized spatiotemporally explicit
cellphone mobility data as surrogate markers for physical distancing, along
with population weighted density and other local data points. We demonstrate at
varying geographical granularity that the spectrum of physical distancing
options currently being discussed among policy leaders have epidemiologically
significant differences in consequences, ranging from viral extinction to near
complete population prevalence. The current mobility inflection points vary
across geographical regions. Experimental results from SIRNet establish
preliminary bounds on such localized mobility that asymptotically induce
containment. The model can support in studying non-pharmacological
interventions and approaches that minimize societal collateral damage and
control mechanisms for an extended period of time.

    <title>Learning to Forecast and Forecasting to Learn from the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Accurate forecasts of COVID-19 is central to resource management and building
strategies to deal with the epidemic. We propose a heterogeneous infection rate
model with human mobility for epidemic modeling, a preliminary version of which
we have successfully used during DARPA Grand Challenge 2014. By linearizing the
model and using weighted least squares, our model is able to quickly adapt to
changing trends and provide extremely accurate predictions of confirmed cases
at the level of countries and states of the United States. We show that during
the earlier part of the epidemic, using travel data increases the predictions.
Training the model to forecast also enables learning characteristics of the
epidemic. In particular, we show that changes in model parameters over time can
help us quantify how well a state or a country has responded to the epidemic.
The variations in parameters also allow us to forecast different scenarios such
as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.

    <title>Comprehensive Investigation and Isolation have Effectively Suppressed
  the Spread of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of COVID-19 since Dec. 2019 has caused severe life and economic
damage worldwide, many countries are trapped by medical resource constraints or
absence of targeted therapeutics, and therefore the implement of systemic
policies to block this pandemic should be prioritized. Based on the
transmission mechanisms and physicochemical properties of betacoronaviruses, we
construct a fine-grained transmission dynamics model (ICRD) to forecast the
crucial information of public concern, therein using dynamical coefficients to
quantify the impact of the implement time and intensity of containment policies
on the spread of epidemic. We find that the comprehensive investigation policy
for susceptible population and the quarantine for suspected cases eminently
contribute to reduce casualties during the phase of the dramatic increase of
diagnosed cases. Statistic evidences strongly suggest that society should take
such forceful public health interventions to cut the infection channels in the
initial stage until the pandemic is interrupted.

    <title>Inside the Mind of Investors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from
  the StockTwits Data</title>
    <summary>  We study the investor beliefs, sentiment and disagreement, about stock market
returns during the COVID-19 pandemic using a large number of messages of
investors on a social media investing platform, \textit{StockTwits}. The rich
and multimodal features of StockTwits data allow us to explore the evolution of
sentiment and disagreement within and across investors, sectors, and even
industries. We find that the sentiment (disagreement) has a sharp decrease
(increase) across all investors with any investment philosophy, horizon, and
experience between February 19, 2020, and March 23, 2020, where a historical
market high followed by a record drop. Surprisingly, these measures have a
sharp reverse toward the end of March. However, the performance of these
measures across various sectors is heterogeneous. Financial and healthcare
sectors are the most pessimistic and optimistic divisions, respectively.

    <title>Heterogeneous contact networks in COVID-19 spreading: the role of social
  deprivation</title>
    <summary>  We have two main aims in this paper. First we use theories of disease
spreading on networks to look at the COVID-19 epidemic on the basis of
individual contacts -- these give rise to predictions which are often rather
different from the homogeneous mixing approaches usually used. Our second aim
is to look at the role of social deprivation, again using networks as our
basis, in the spread of this epidemic. We choose the city of Kolkata as a case
study, but assert that the insights so obtained are applicable to a wide
variety of urban environments which are densely populated and where social
inequalities are rampant. Our predictions of hotspots are found to be in good
agreement with those currently being identifed empirically as containment zones
and provide a useful guide for identifying potential areas of concern.

    <title>Minimal epidemic model considering external infected injection and
  governmental quarantine policies: Application to COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Due to modern transportation networks (airplanes, cruise ships, etc.) an
epidemic in a given country or city may be triggered by the arrival of external
infected agents. Posterior government quarantine policies are usually taken in
order to control the epidemic growth. We formulate a minimal epidemic evolution
model that takes into account these components. The previous and posterior
evolutions to the quarantine policy are modeled in a separate way by
considering different complexities parameters in each stage. Application of
this model to COVID-19 data in different countries is implemented. Estimations
of the infected peak time-occurrence and epidemic saturation values as well as
possible post-quarantine scenarios are analyzed over the basis of the model,
reported data, and the fraction of the population that adopts the quarantine
policy.

    <title>Importance of suppression and mitigation measures in managing COVID-19
  outbreaks</title>
    <summary>  I employ a simple mathematical model of an epidemic process to evaluate how
four basic quantities: the reproduction number (R), the numbers of sensitive
(S) and infectious individuals(I), and total community size (N) affect
strategies to control COVID-19. Numerical simulations show that strict
suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious
numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer
periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure,
the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to
subsequent management. We discuss the predictions of this analysis and how it
fits into longer-term sequences of measures, including using the herd immunity
concept to leverage acquired immunity.

    <title>Pandemic, Shutdown and Consumer Spending: Lessons from Scandinavian
  Policy Responses to COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  This paper uses transaction data from a large bank in Scandinavia to estimate
the effect of social distancing laws on consumer spending in the COVID-19
pandemic. The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects
of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were
similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant
restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate
spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the
shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most
of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless
of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggest that
social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low
health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering
the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.

    <title>Predictive Analysis of COVID-19 Time-series Data from Johns Hopkins
  University</title>
    <summary>  We provide a predictive analysis of the spread of COVID-19, also known as
SARS-CoV-2, using the dataset made publicly available online by the Johns
Hopkins University. Our main objective is to provide predictions of the number
of infected people for different countries in the next 14 days. The predictive
analysis is done using time-series data transformed on a logarithmic scale. We
use two well-known methods for prediction: polynomial regression and neural
network. As the number of training data for each country is limited, we use a
single-layer neural network called the extreme learning machine (ELM) to avoid
over-fitting. Due to the non-stationary nature of the time-series, a sliding
window approach is used to provide a more accurate prediction.

    <title>The impact of undetected cases on tracking epidemics: the case of
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  One of the key indicators used in tracking the evolution of an infectious
disease isthe reproduction number. This quantity is usually computed using the
reportednumber of cases, but ignoring that many more individuals may be
infected (e.g.asymptomatics). We propose a statistical procedure to quantify
the impact of un-detected infectious cases on the determination of the
effective reproduction number. Our approach is stochastic, data-driven and not
relying on any compartmentalmodel. It is applied to the COVID-19 case in eight
different countries and all Italianregions, showing that the effect of
undetected cases leads to estimates of the effective reproduction numbers
larger than those obtained only with the reported cases by factors ranging from
two to ten. Our findings urge caution about deciding when and how to relax
containment measures based on the value of the reproduction number.

    <title>Human Mobility in Response to COVID-19 in France, Italy and UK</title>
    <summary>  The policies implemented to hinder the COVID-19 outbreak represent one of the
largest critical events in history. The understanding of this process is
fundamental for crafting and tailoring post-disaster relief. In this work we
perform a massive data analysis, through geolocalized data from 13M Facebook
users, on how such a stress affected mobility patterns in France, Italy and UK.
We find that the general reduction of the overall efficiency in the network of
movements is accompanied by geographical fragmentation with a massive reduction
of long-range connections. The impact, however, differs among nations according
to their initial mobility structure. Indeed, we find that the mobility network
after the lockdown is more concentrated in the case of France and UK and more
distributed in Italy. Such a process can be approximated through percolation to
quantify the substantial impact of the lockdown.

    <title>Group testing as a strategy for the epidemiologic monitoring of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  In this article, we propose an analysis and applications of sample pooling to
the epidemiologic monitoring of COVID-19 with an economy of tests. We first
show that group testing is a theoretically efficient and economic tool to
provide a direct measure of the prevalence of the disease. We then introduce a
precise model of the RT-qPCR process, used to test for the presence of virus in
a sample. We construct a statistical model for the viral load in a typical
infected individual based on clinical data from Jones et. al. (2020). Using
these models, we then propose a method for the measure of the prevalence in a
population, based on group testing, taking into account the increased number of
false negatives associated to this method. Finally, we present an application
of sample pooling for the prevention of epidemic outbreak in relatively closed
connected communities (e.g. care homes for the elderly).

    <title>Simpson's paradox in Covid-19 case fatality rates: a mediation analysis
  of age-related causal effects</title>
    <summary>  We point out an example of Simpson's paradox in COVID-19 case fatality rates
(CFRs): comparing data from $&gt;72,000$ cases from China with data from Italy
reported on March 9th, we find that CFRs are lower in Italy for each age group,
but higher overall. This phenomenon can be explained by a stark difference in
case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example,
we review basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used
to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a
coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and mortality. As a case
study, we then investigate how total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated)
causal effects between China and Italy evolve over two months until May 7th
2020.

    <title>Nowcasting fatal COVID-19 infections on a regional level in Germany</title>
    <summary>  We analyse the temporal and regional structure in mortality rates related to
COVID-19 infections. We relate the fatality date of each deceased patient to
the corresponding day of registration of the infection, leading to a nowcasting
model which allows us to estimate the number of present-day infections that
will, at a later date, prove to be fatal. The numbers are broken down to the
district level in Germany. Given that death counts generally provide more
reliable information on the spread of the disease compared to infection counts,
which inevitably depend on testing strategy and capacity, the proposed model
and the presented results allow to obtain reliable insight into the current
state of the pandemic in Germany.

    <title>Bayesian adjustment for preferential testing in estimating the COVID-19
  infection fatality rate: Theory and methods</title>
    <summary>  A key challenge in estimating the infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19
is determining the total number of cases. The total number of cases is not
known because not everyone is tested but also, more importantly, because tested
individuals are not representative of the population at large. We refer to the
phenomenon whereby infected individuals are more likely to be tested than
non-infected individuals, as "preferential testing." An open question is
whether or not it is possible to reliably estimate the IFR without any specific
knowledge about the degree to which the data are biased by preferential
testing. In this paper we take a partial identifiability approach, formulating
clearly where deliberate prior assumptions can be made and presenting a
Bayesian model, which pools information from different samples. Results suggest
that when limited knowledge is available about the magnitude of preferential
testing, reliable estimation of the IFR is still possible so long as there is
sufficient "heterogeneity of bias" across samples.

    <title>Mathematical model of COVID-19 intervention scenarios for Sao Paulo-
  Brazil</title>
    <summary>  An epidemiological compartmental model was used to simulate social distancing
strategies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent a second wave in Sao
Paulo, Brazil. Optimization using genetic algorithm was used to determine the
optimal solutions. Our results suggest the best-case strategy for Sao Paulo is
to maintain or increase the current magnitude of social distancing for at least
60 more days and increase the current levels of personal protection behaviors
by a minimum of 10% (e.g., wearing facemasks, proper hand hygiene and avoid
agglomeration). Followed by a long-term oscillatory level of social distancing
with a stepping-down approach every 80 days over a period of two years with
continued protective behavior.

    <title>COVID-19 puzzle in China: a serendipitous interplay between
  transmissibility and social distancing measures</title>
    <summary>  Drastic difference in the COVID-19 infection and fatality counts, observed
between Hubei (Wuhan) and other Mainland China provinces raised public
controversies. To address if these data can be consistently understood, we
develop a model that takes into account all main qualitative features of the
infection progression under suppression measures, while remaining simple enough
to estimate the key dynamics parameters. We find that social distancing
measures had a large effect in the provinces, where moreover higher
transmissibility appears to have triggered more effective protection. Hubei is,
however, a far outlier with significantly larger transmissibility, but lower
protection. Predicted infection attack rate is significantly higher for Hubei,
but much lower than necessary for herd immunity. Case Fatality Rate is five
times larger in Hubei, but our estimated Infection Fatality Rates are much more
uniform/consistent across all provinces. Therefore, interplay of
transmissibility, effective protection, and detection efficiency differences
may explain apparently drastic count discrepancies.

    <title>A Bayesian - Deep Learning model for estimating Covid-19 evolution in
  Spain</title>
    <summary>  This work proposes a semi-parametric approach to estimate Covid-19
(SARS-CoV-2) evolution in Spain. Considering the sequences of cases, deaths,
and recovered of all Spanish regions, it combines modern Deep Learning (DL)
techniques for analyzing sequences with the usual Bayesian Poisson-Gamma model
for counts. DL model provides a suitable description of observed sequences but
no reliable uncertainty quantification around it can be obtained. To overcome
this we use the prediction from DL as an expert elicitation of the expected
number of counts and thus obtaining the posterior predictive distribution of
counts in an orthodox Bayesian analysis. The overall resulting model allows us
to either predict the future evolution of the sequences on all regions, as well
as, estimating the consequences of eventual future scenarios.

    <title>Estimating Hidden Asymptomatics, Herd Immunity Threshold and Lockdown
  Effects using a COVID-19 Specific Model</title>
    <summary>  A quantitative COVID-19 model that incorporates hidden asymptomatic patients
is developed, and an analytic solution in parametric form is given. The model
incorporates the impact of lockdown and resulting spatial migration of
population due to announcement of lockdown. A method is presented for
estimating the model parameters from real-world data. It is shown that increase
of infections slows down and herd immunity is achieved when symptomatic
patients are 4-6\% of the population for the European countries we studied,
when the total infected fraction is between 50-56 \%. Finally, a method for
estimating the number of asymptomatic patients, who have been the key hidden
link in the spread of the infections, is presented.

    <title>A review of information security aspects of the emerging COVID-19
  contact tracing mobile phone applications</title>
    <summary>  This paper discusses the aspects of data reliability and user privacy for the
emerging practice of mobile phone based contact tracing for the COVID-19
pandemic. Various countries and large technology companies have already used or
plan to design and use mobile phone based solutions, in an effort to urgently
expedite the process of identifying people who may have been exposed to the
disease and limit its spread to the general population. However, serious
concerns have been raised both in terms of the validity of the collected data
as well as the extent to which implemented approaches can breach the privacy of
the mobile phone users. This review examines the weaknesses of existing
implementations and concludes with specific recommendations that can contribute
towards increasing the safety of infrastructures that collect and process this
kind of information, as well as the adoption and acceptance of these solutions
from the public.

    <title>Forecasting the transmission of Covid-19 in India using a data driven
  SEIRD model</title>
    <summary>  The infections and fatalities due to SARS-CoV-2 virus for cases specific to
India have been studied using a deterministic
susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) compartmental model. One of
the most significant epidemiological parameter, namely the effective
reproduction number of the infection is extracted from the daily growth rate
data of reported infections and it is included in the model with a time
variation. We evaluate the effect of control interventions implemented till now
and estimate the case numbers for infections and deaths averted by these
restrictive measures. We further provide a forecast on the extent of the future
Covid-19 transmission in India and predict the probable numbers of infections
and fatalities under various potential scenarios.

    <title>A Review of Automatically Diagnosing COVID-19 based on Scanning Image</title>
    <summary>  The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused millions of infectious. Due to the
false-negative rate and the time cost of conventional RT-PCR tests, X-ray
images and Computed Tomography (CT) images based diagnosing become widely
adopted. Therefore, researchers of the computer vision area have developed many
automatic diagnosing models to help the radiologists and pro-mote the
diagnosing accuracy. In this paper, we present a review of these recently
emerging automatic diagnosing models. 62 models from 14, February to 5, May,
2020 are involved. We analyzed the models from the perspective of
preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and evaluation. Then we
pointed out that domain adaption in transfer learning and interpretability
promotion are the possible future directions.

    <title>Optimal frequency setting of metro services in the age of COVID-19
  distancing measures</title>
    <summary>  Public transport is one of the most disrupted sectors of the COVID-19
pandemic with reported ridership drops up to 90% in majorly affected countries.
As many government authorities strive to partially resume activities, public
transport operators are in an urgent need for models that can evaluate the
impact of different social distancing policies on operational and
passenger-related costs. In this study, we introduce a mixed-integer quadratic
programming model for the redesign of public transport services considering the
operational, passenger, and revenue loss-related costs by evaluating the
effects of different social distancing policies. Our model is applied at the
metro network of Washington D.C. and provides optimal redistribution of
vehicles across lines for different social distancing scenarios. This model can
be used as a decision support tool by other policymakers and public transport
operators that are in need of evaluating the costs related to the
implementation of different social distancing policies.

    <title>Satellite-based estimates of decline and rebound in China's CO$_2$
  emissions during COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Changes in CO$_2$ emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been estimated
from indicators on activities like transportation and electricity generation.
Here, we instead use satellite observations together with bottom-up information
to track the daily dynamics of CO$_2$ emissions during the pandemic. Unlike
activity data, our observation-based analysis can be independently evaluated
and can provide more detailed insights into spatially-explicit changes.
Specifically, we use TROPOMI observations of NO$_2$ to deduce ten-day moving
averages of NO$_x$ and CO$_2$ emissions over China, differentiating emissions
by sector and province. Between January and April 2020, China's CO$_2$
emissions fell by 11.5% compared to the same period in 2019, but emissions have
since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels owing to the fast economic recovery in
provinces where industrial activity is concentrated.

    <title>A note on community-detection (Kemeny) based testing for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The Kemeny constant of a graph can be used to identify and analyse bridges
between communities in a graph. Testing, tracking and tracing abilities have
been identified as pivotal in helping countries to safely reopen activities
after the first wave of the COVID-19 virus. Tracing techniques aim at
reconstructing past history of contacts, but can face practical limits in an
exponential growth of either testing or overly conservative quarantining. We
show how this application of graph theory can be conveniently used to
efficiently intercept new virus outbreaks, when they are still in their early
stage. Simulations provide promising results in early identification and
blocking of possible "super-spreader links that transmit disease between
different communities.

    <title>Nonlinear dynamic analysis of an epidemiological model for COVID-19
  including public behavior and government action</title>
    <summary>  This paper is concerned with nonlinear modeling and analysis of the COVID-19
pandemic currently ravaging the planet. There are two objectives: to arrive at
an appropriate model that captures the collected data faithfully, and to use
that as a basis to explore the nonlinear behavior. We use a nonlinear SEIR
(Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious &amp; Removed) transmission model with added
behavioral and government policy dynamics. We develop a genetic algorithm
technique to identify key model parameters employing COVID19 data from South
Korea. Stability, bifurcations and dynamic behavior are analyzed. Parametric
analysis reveals conditions for sustained epidemic equilibria to occur. This
work points to the value of nonlinear dynamic analysis in pandemic modeling and
demonstrates the dramatic influence of social and government behavior on
disease dynamics.

    <title>COVID-19 response needs to broaden financial inclusion to curb the rise
  in poverty</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic risks wiping out years of progress made in
reducing global poverty. In this paper, we explore to what extent financial
inclusion could help mitigate the increase in poverty using cross-country data
across 78 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Unlike other recent
cross-country studies, we show that financial inclusion is a key driver of
poverty reduction in these countries. This effect is not direct, but indirect,
by mitigating the detrimental effect that inequality has on poverty. Our
findings are consistent across all the different measures of poverty used. Our
forecasts suggest that the world's population living on less than $1.90 per day
could increase from 8% to 14% by 2021, pushing nearly 400 million people into
poverty. However, urgent improvements in financial inclusion could
substantially reduce the impact on poverty.

    <title>Uncertainty quantification for epidemiological forecasts of COVID-19
  through combinations of model predictions</title>
    <summary>  A common statistical problem is prediction, or forecasting, in the presence
of an ensemble of multiple candidate models. For example, multiple candidate
models may be available to predict case numbers in a disease epidemic,
resulting from different modelling approaches (e.g. mechanistic or empirical)
or differing assumptions about spatial or age mixing. Alternative models
capture genuine uncertainty in scientific understanding of disease dynamics,
and/or different simplifying assumptions underpinning each model derivation.
While the analysis of multi-model ensembles can be computationally challenging,
accounting for this 'structural uncertainty' can improve forecast accuracy and
reduce the risk of over-estimated confidence. In this paper we look at
combining epidemiological forecasts for COVID-19 daily deaths, hospital
admissions, and hospital and ICU occupancy, in order to improve the predictive
accuracy of the short term forecasts. We combining models via combinations of
individual predictive densities with weights chosen via application of
predictive scoring, as commonly applied in meteorological and economic
forecasting.

    <title>A Machine Learning Application for Raising WASH Awareness in the Times
  of COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Proactive management of an Infodemic that grows faster than the underlying
epidemic is a modern-day challenge. This requires raising awareness and
sensitization with the correct information in order to prevent and contain
outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, there is a fine
balance between continuous awareness-raising by providing new information and
the risk of misinformation. In this work, we address this gap by creating a
life-long learning application that delivers authentic information to users in
Hindi and English, the most widely used languages in India. It does this by
matching sources of verified and authentic information such as the WHO reports
against daily news by using machine learning and natural language processing.
It delivers the narrated content in Hindi by using state-of-the-art text to
speech engines. Finally, the approach allows user input for continuous
improvement of news feed relevance daily. We demonstrate this approach for
Water, Sanitation, Hygiene information for containment of the COVID-19
pandemic. Thirteen combinations of pre-processing strategies, word-embeddings,
and similarity metrics were evaluated by eight human users via calculation of
agreement statistics. The best performing combination achieved a Cohen's Kappa
of 0.54 and was deployed as On AIr, WashKaro's AI-powered back-end. We
introduced a novel way of contact tracing, deploying the Bluetooth sensors of
an individual's smartphone and automatic recording of physical interactions
with other users. Additionally, the application also features a symptom
self-assessment tool based on WHO-approved guidelines, human-curated and vetted
information to reach out to the community as audio-visual content in local
languages. WashKaro - http://tiny.cc/WashKaro

    <title>Window of Opportunity for Mitigation to Prevent Overflow of ICU capacity
  in Chicago by COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We estimate the growth in demand for ICU beds in Chicago during the emerging
COVID-19 epidemic, using state-of-the-art computer simulations calibrated for
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The questions we address are these:
  (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much?
  (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place
order, prevent the overflow of capacity?
  (3) When should such strategies be implemented?
  Our answers are as follows:
  (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor
of ten.
  (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but
even that will not work if implemented too late.
  (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19
can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the
strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be
successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the
emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of
deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the
precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties
in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion
that it exists and will soon be closed.
  Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs,
there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario
in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next
week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and
then strong mitigation/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too
late.

    <title>How macroscopic laws describe complex dynamics: asymptomatic population
  and CoviD-19 spreading</title>
    <summary>  Macroscopic growth laws, solutions of mean field equations, describe in an
effective way an underlying complex dynamics. They are applied to study the
spreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the
cumulated number $N(t)$ of detected infected individuals is a generally
accepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. However
$N(t)$ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not
detected, cases $A(t)$. Therefore, the question arises if the observed time
series of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the
infectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which
includes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The
solution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population $N(t)$
coming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit
reference to $A(t)$, showing the equivalence of the two methods. Indeed, $N(t)$
takes into account a more complex and detailed population dynamics which
permits the evaluation of the number of asymptomatic individuals also. The
model is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an
exponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more
recent data. Then the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is
reliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the
total infected population. The asymptomatic population is larger than the
symptomatic one in the fast growth phase of the spreading.

    <title>Give more data, awareness and control to individual citizens, and they
  will help COVID-19 containment</title>
    <summary>  The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick and effective tracking of
virus transmission chains and early detection of outbreaks, especially in the
phase 2 of the pandemic, when lockdown and other restriction measures are
progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion resurgence.
For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale
adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the
app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens'
privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the
need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We
advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both
contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens'
"personal data stores", to be shared separately and selectively, voluntarily,
only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy
preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal
sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed
information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and,
in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak
hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is
two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light
touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the
device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when
they want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second,
we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision,
giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure
they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for
rebuilding society.

    <title>Modeling the Heterogeneity in COVID-19's Reproductive Number and its
  Impact on Predictive Scenarios</title>
    <summary>  The current COVID-19 pandemic is leading experts to assess the risks posed by
the disease and compare policies geared towards stalling its evolution as a
global pandemic. In this setting, the virus' basic reproductive number R_0,
which characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each
primary case, takes on a significant importance in the quantification of the
potential scope of the pandemic. Yet, in most models, R_0 is assumed to be a
universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and populations --
thus neglecting the inherent variability of the transmission process due to
varying population densities, demographics, temporal factors, etc. In fact, it
can be shown that the reproduction number is highly variable. Considering its
expected value thus leads to biased or loose results in the reported predictive
scenarios, especially as these are tailored to a given country or region. The
goal of this paper is the examination of the impact of the reproductive number
R's variability on important output metrics, and the percolation of this
variability in projected scenarios so as to provide uncertainty quantification.
In this perspective, instead of considering a single R_0, we consider a
distribution of reproductive numbers R and devise a simple Bayesian
hierarchical model that builds upon current methods for estimating the R to
integrate its heterogeneity. We then simulate the spread of the epidemic, and
the impact of different social distancing strategies using a probabilistic
framework that models hospital occupancy. This shows the strong impact of this
added variability on the reported results. We emphasize that our goal is not to
replace benchmark methods for estimating the basic reproductive numbers, but
rather to discuss the importance of the impact of R's heterogeneity on
uncertainty quantification for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Prospects and limits of SIR-type Mathematical Models to Capture the
  COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  For the description of a pandemic mathematical models could be interesting.
Both for physicians and politicians as a base for decisions to treat the
disease. The responsible estimation of parameters is a main issue of
mathematical pandemic models. Especially a good choice of $\beta$ as the number
of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day)
influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the actual
COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed.
Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University to
the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as a base for the
parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis
will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown.
As example of the parameter choice serve the data of the USA and the UK. The
resulting parameters will be used estimated and used in W.\,O. Kermack and
A.\,G. McKendrick's SIR model. Strategies for the commencing and ending of
social and economic shutdown measures are discussed. The numerical solution of
the ordinary differential equation system of the modified SIR model is being
done with a Runge-Kutta integration method of fourth order. At the end the
applicability of the SIR model could be shown essentially. Suggestions about
appropriate points in time at which to commence with lockdown measures based on
the acceleration rate of infections conclude the paper.

    <title>Bayesian dynamical estimation of the parameters of an SE(A)IR COVID-19
  spread model</title>
    <summary>  In this article, we consider a dynamic epidemiology model for the spread of
the COVID-19 infection. Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is
modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying
pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary
infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the
model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious
individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A
Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the
relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new
data on the number of new infections and disease related death become
available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate
is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of
the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The
sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the
uncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction
number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a
dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and
symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the
quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that
plays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we
apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from
several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the
proposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within
both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the
mitigation measures.

    <title>Regional analysis of COVID-19 in France from fit of hospital data with
  different evolutionary models</title>
    <summary>  The SIR evolutionary model predicts too sharp a decrease of the fractions of
people infected with COVID-19 in France after the start of the national
lockdown, compared to what is observed. I fit the daily hospital data: arrivals
in regular and critical care units, releases and deaths, using extended SEIR
models. These involve ratios of evolutionary timescales to branching fractions,
assumed uniform throughout a country, and the basic reproduction number, $R_0$,
before and during the national lockdown, for each region of France. The
joint-region Bayesian analysis allows precise evaluations of the time/fraction
ratios and pre-hospitalized fractions. The hospital data are well fit by the
models, except the arrivals in critical care, which decrease faster than
predicted, indicating better treatment over time. Averaged over France, the
analysis yields $R_0$= 3.4$\pm$0.1 before the lockdown and 0.65$\pm$0.04 (90%
c.l.) during the lockdown, with small regional variations. On 11 May 2020, the
Infection Fatality Rate in France was 4 $\pm$1% (90% c.l.), while the Feverish
vastly outnumber the Asymptomatic, contrary to the early phases. Without the
lockdown nor social distancing, over 2 million deaths from COVID-19 would have
occurred throughout France, while a lockdown that would have been enforced 10
days earlier would have led to less than 1000 deaths. The fraction of immunized
people reached a plateau below 1% throughout France (3% in Paris) by late April
2020 (95% c.l.), suggesting a lack of herd immunity. The widespread
availability of face masks on 11 May, when the lockdown was partially lifted,
should keep $R_0$ below unity if at least 46% of the population wear them
outside their home. Otherwise, without enhanced other social distancing, a
second wave is inevitable and cause the number of deaths to triple between
early May and October (if $R_0$=1.2) or even late June (if $R_0$=2).

    <title>A Deep Q-learning/genetic Algorithms Based Novel Methodology For
  Optimizing Covid-19 Pandemic Government Actions</title>
    <summary>  Whenever countries are threatened by a pandemic, as is the case with the
COVID-19 virus, governments should take the right actions to safeguard public
health as well as to mitigate the negative effects on the economy. In this
regard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a
restrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously
damage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may
put at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be
somewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is
necessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other
measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible -
Exposed - Infected - Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the
evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the
best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with
two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic
Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter
distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system
focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that
hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding
taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage
to the economy. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid
tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of
a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep
Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the
sequences of actions.

    <title>An Optimal Predictive Control Strategy for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Social
  Distancing Policies in Brazil</title>
    <summary>  The global COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the defining health crisis
of our century. Due to the absence of vaccines and drugs that can help to fight
it, the world solution to control the spread has been to consider public social
distance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In this
context, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determine
the time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data in
the period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the number
of infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to the
absence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomatic
individuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using an
uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal and
inconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR model
an additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population to
the social distancing policies determined by the government that affects the
speed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logical
formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence or
the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to
avoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulation
results to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. These
results point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August
2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before the
beginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days.
This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The second peak of
infections, which has a forecast to the beginning of October, can be reduced if
the periods of no-isolation days are shortened.

    <title>SciSight: Combining faceted navigation and research group detection for
  COVID-19 exploratory scientific search</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked unprecedented mobilization of scientists,
already generating thousands of new papers that join a litany of previous
biomedical work in related areas. This deluge of information makes it hard for
researchers to keep track of their own research area, let alone explore new
directions. Standard search engines are designed primarily for targeted search
and are not geared for discovery or making connections that are not obvious
from reading individual papers. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on
SciSight, a novel framework for exploratory search of COVID-19 research. Based
on formative interviews with scientists and a review of existing tools, we
build and integrate two key capabilities: first, exploring interactions between
biomedical facets (e.g., proteins, genes, drugs, diseases, patient
characteristics); and second, discovering groups of researchers and how they
are connected. We extract entities using a language model pre-trained on
several biomedical information extraction tasks, and enrich them with data from
the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). To find research groups automatically, we
use hierarchical clustering with overlap to allow authors, as they do, to
belong to multiple groups. Finally, we introduce a novel presentation of these
groups based on both topical and social affinities, allowing users to drill
down from groups to papers to associations between entities, and update query
suggestions on the fly with the goal of facilitating exploratory navigation.
SciSight has thus far served over 10K users with over 30K page views and 13%
returning users. Preliminary user interviews with biomedical researchers
suggest that SciSight complements current approaches and helps find new and
relevant knowledge.

    <title>COVID-19 and Global Economic Growth: Policy Simulations with a
  Pandemic-Enabled Neoclassical Growth Model</title>
    <summary>  During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019/2020, authorities have used temporary
ad-hoc policy measures, such as lockdowns and mass quarantines, to slow its
transmission. However, the consequences of widespread use of these
unprecedented measures are poorly understood. To contribute to the
understanding of the economic and human consequences of such policy measures,
we therefore construct a mathematical model of an economy under the impact of a
pandemic, select parameter values to represent the global economy under the
impact of COVID-19, and perform numerical experiments by simulating a large
number of possible policy responses. By varying the starting date of the policy
intervention in the simulated scenarios, we find that the most effective policy
intervention occurs around the time when the number of active infections is
growing at its highest rate -- that is, the results suggest that the most
severe measures should only be implemented when the disease is sufficiently
spread. The intensity of the intervention, above a certain threshold, does not
appear to have a great impact on the outcomes in our simulations, due to the
strongly concave relationship that we identify between production shortfall and
infection rate reductions. Our experiments further suggest that the
intervention should last until after the peak established by the reduced
infection rate, which implies that stricter policies should last longer. The
model and its implementation, along with the general insights from our policy
experiments, may help policymakers design effective emergency policy responses
in the face of a serious pandemic, and contribute to our understanding of the
relationship between the economic growth and the spread of infectious diseases.

    <title>COVID-19 Epidemic Study II: Phased Emergence From the Lockdown in Mumbai</title>
    <summary>  The nation-wide lockdown starting 25 March 2020, aimed at suppressing the
spread of the COVID-19 disease, was extended until 31 May 2020 in three
subsequent orders by the Government of India. The extended lockdown has had
significant social and economic consequences and `lockdown fatigue' has likely
set in. Phased reopening began from 01 June 2020 onwards. Mumbai, one of the
most crowded cities in the world, has witnessed both the largest number of
cases and deaths among all the cities in India (41986 positive cases and 1368
deaths as of 02 June 2020). Many tough decisions are going to be made on
re-opening in the next few days. In an earlier IISc-TIFR Report, we presented
an agent-based city-scale simulator(ABCS) to model the progression and spread
of the infection in large metropolises like Mumbai and Bengaluru. As discussed
in IISc-TIFR Report 1, ABCS is a useful tool to model interactions of city
residents at an individual level and to capture the impact of
non-pharmaceutical interventions on the infection spread. In this report we
focus on Mumbai. Using our simulator, we consider some plausible scenarios for
phased emergence of Mumbai from the lockdown, 01 June 2020 onwards. These
include phased and gradual opening of the industry, partial opening of public
transportation (modelling of infection spread in suburban trains), impact of
containment zones on controlling infections, and the role of compliance with
respect to various intervention measures including use of masks, case
isolation, home quarantine, etc. The main takeaway of our simulation results is
that a phased opening of workplaces, say at a conservative attendance level of
20 to 33\%, is a good way to restart economic activity while ensuring that the
city's medical care capacity remains adequate to handle the possible rise in
the number of COVID-19 patients in June and July.

    <title>Projecting and comparing non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain
  COVID-19 in major economies</title>
    <summary>  Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as quarantine, self-isolation,
social distancing, and virus-contact tracing can greatly reduce the spread of
the virus during a pandemic. In the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many
countries have implemented various NPIs for infection control and mitigation.
However, the stringency of the NPIs and the resulting impact among different
countries remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative factors. In this study
we took a further step to incorporate the effect of the NPIs into the pandemic
dynamics model using the concept of policy intensity factor (PIF). This idea
enables us to characterize the transition rates as time varying quantities
instead of constant values, and thus capturing the dynamical behavior of the
basic reproduction number variation in the pandemic. By leveraging a great
amount of data reported by the governments and the World Health Organization,
we projected the dynamics of the pandemic for the major economies in the world,
including the numbers of infected, susceptible, and recovered cases, as well as
the pandemic durations. It is observed that the proposed variable-rate
susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (VR-SEIR) model fits and projects the
pandemic dynamics very well. We further showed that the resulting PIFs
correlate with the stringency of NPIs, which allows us to project the final
affected numbers of people in those countries when their current NPIs have been
imposed for 90, 180, 360 days. It provides a quantitative insight into the
effectiveness of the implemented NPIs, and sheds a new light on minimizing both
affected people from COVID-19 and the economic impact.

    <title>COVID-19 and Company Knowledge Graphs: Assessing Golden Powers and
  Economic Impact of Selective Lockdown via AI Reasoning</title>
    <summary>  In the COVID-19 outbreak, governments have applied progressive restrictions
to production activities, permitting only those that are considered strategic
or that provide essential services. This is particularly apparent in countries
that have been stricken hard by the virus, with Italy being a major example.
Yet we know that companies are not just isolated entities: They organize
themselves into intricate shareholding structures --- forming company networks
--- distributing decision power and dividends in sophisticated schemes for
various purposes.
  One tool from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) toolbox that is particularly
effective to perform reasoning tasks on domains characterized by many entities
highly interconnected with one another is Knowledge Graphs (KG). In this work,
we present a visionary opinion and report on ongoing work about the application
of Automated Reasoning and Knowledge Graph technology to address the impact of
the COVID-19 outbreak on the network of Italian companies and support the
application of legal instruments for the protection of strategic companies from
takeovers.

    <title>Advancing computerized cognitive training for early Alzheimer's disease
  in a Covid-19 pandemic and post-pandemic world</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed mobile health applications and
telemedicine from nice to have tools into essential healthcare infrastructure.
This need is particularly great for the elderly who, due to their greater risk
for infection, may avoid medical facilities or be required to self-isolate.
These are also the very groups at highest risk for cognitive decline. For
example, during the COVID-19 pandemic artificially intelligent conversational
agents were employed by hospitals and government agencies (such as the CDC) to
field queries from patients about symptoms and treatments. Digital health tools
also proved invaluable to provide neuropsychiatric and psychological self-help
to people isolated at home or in retirement centers and nursing homes.

    <title>Altruism and anxiety: Engagement with online community support
  initiatives (OCSIs) during Covid-19 lockdown in the UK and Ireland</title>
    <summary>  Given concerns about mental health during periods of Covid-19 lockdown, it
important to understand how engagement with online Covid-19 related material
can affect mood. In the UK and Ireland, online community support initiatives
(OCSIs) have emerged to help people manage their lives. Yet, little is known
about how people engaged with these or whether they influenced subsequent mood.
We conducted surveys to explore how people in the UK and Ireland engaged with
OCSIs, and found that 70% did so to offer support (e.g. to provide company).
Those who did so reported feeling significantly calmer afterwards, those who
engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour)
reported feeling significantly more anxious afterwards, but there was no
difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to
share experiences or views). Thus, engaging with an OCSI for altruistic
purposes might help to make people feel calmer.

have pushed authorities to apply restrictive policies to control its spreading.
As data drove most of the decisions made in this global contingency, their
quality is a critical variable for decision-making actors, and therefore should
be carefully curated. In this work, we analyze the sources of error in
typically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used for
diagnosis, and their impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading
dynamics. We address the existence of different delays in the report of new
cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time
gaps, and other error sources related to the sensitivity/specificity of the
tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Using a statistically-based algorithm, we
perform a temporal reclassification of cases to avoid delay-induced errors,
building up new epidemiologic curves centered in the day where the contagion
effectively occurred. We also statistically enhance the robustness behind the
discharge/recovery clinical criteria in the absence of a direct test, which is
typically the case of non-first world countries, where the limited testing
capabilities are fully dedicated to the evaluation of new cases. Finally, we
applied our methodology to assess the evolution of the pandemic in Chile
through the Basic Reproduction Number $R_0$, identifying different moments in
which data was misleading governmental actions. In doing so, we aim to raise
public awareness of the need for proper data reporting and processing protocols
for epidemiological modelling and predictions.

    <title>A model for the spread of an epidemic from local to global: A case study
  of COVID-19 in India</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we propose an epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19.
The dynamics of the spread is based on four fundamental categories of people in
a population: Tested and infected, Non-Tested but infected, Tested but not
infected, and non-Tested and not infected. The model is based on two levels of
dynamics of spread in the population: at local level and at the global level.
The local level growth is described with data and parameters which include
testing statistics for COVID-19, preventive measures such as nationwide
lockdown, and the migration of people across neighboring locations. In the
context of India, the local locations are considered as districts and migration
or traffic flow across districts are defined by normalized edge weight of the
metapopulation network of districts which are infected with COVID-19. Based on
this local growth, state level predictions for number of people tested with
COVID-19 positive are made. Further, considering the local locations as states,
prediction is made for the country level. The values of the model parameters
are determined using grid search and minimizing an error function while
training the model with real data. The predictions are made based on the
present statistics of testing, and certain linear and log-linear growth of
testing at state and country level. Finally, it is shown that the spread can be
contained if number of testing can be increased linearly or log-linearly by
certain factors along with the preventive measures in near future. This is also
necessary to prevent the sharp growth in the count of infected and to get rid
of the second wave of pandemic.

    <title>On the uncertainty of real-time predictions of epidemic growths: a
  COVID-19 case study for China and Italy</title>
    <summary>  While COVID-19 is rapidly propagating around the globe, the need for
providing real-time forecasts of the epidemics pushes fits of dynamical and
statistical models to available data beyond their capabilities. Here we focus
on statistical predictions of COVID-19 infections performed by fitting
asymptotic distributions to actual data. By taking as a case-study the epidemic
evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Chinese provinces and Italian
regions, we find that predictions are characterized by large uncertainties at
the early stages of the epidemic growth. Those uncertainties significantly
reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of
the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the
spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics
counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on
the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the
intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics. These results
suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide
uncertainty ranges and urge for the needs of compiling high-quality datasets of
infections counts, including asymptomatic patients.

    <title>Forecast analysis of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in the United
  States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR model is proposed, denoted
by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of
the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect
diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are
analyzed. The basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ is derived. When $R_{0}&lt;1$, the
disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable.
When $R_{0}&gt;1$, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some
conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of
disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in
the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual
behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is
proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United
States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for
the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the
United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated
cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the
development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for
understanding the trend of the outbreak.

    <title>Modelling the role of media induced fear conditioning in mitigating
  post-lockdown COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives on India</title>
    <summary>  Several countries that have been successful in constraining the severity of
COVID-19 pandemic via "lockdown" are now considering to slowly end it, mainly
because of enormous socio-economic side-effects. An abrupt ending of lockdown
can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore,
carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post
upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of
COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social
contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and
Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with
fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet
and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase
in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth
of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown
phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools
for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical
intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed
SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear
conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country
specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.

    <title>Data-Driven Methods to Monitor, Model, Forecast and Control Covid-19
  Pandemic: Leveraging Data Science, Epidemiology and Control Theory</title>
    <summary>  This document analyzes the role of data-driven methodologies in Covid-19
pandemic. We provide a SWOT analysis and a roadmap that goes from the access to
data sources to the final decision-making step. We aim to review the available
methodologies while anticipating the difficulties and challenges in the
development of data-driven strategies to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. A
3M-analysis is presented: Monitoring, Modelling and Making decisions. The focus
is on the potential of well-known datadriven schemes to address different
challenges raised by the pandemic: i) monitoring and forecasting the spread of
the epidemic; (ii) assessing the effectiveness of government decisions; (iii)
making timely decisions. Each step of the roadmap is detailed through a review
of consolidated theoretical results and their potential application in the
Covid-19 context. When possible, we provide examples of their applications on
past or present epidemics. We do not provide an exhaustive enumeration of
methodologies, algorithms and applications. We do try to serve as a bridge
between different disciplines required to provide a holistic approach to the
epidemic: data science, epidemiology, controltheory, etc. That is, we highlight
effective data-driven methodologies that have been shown to be successful in
other contexts and that have potential application in the different steps of
the proposed roadmap. To make this document more functional and adapted to the
specifics of each discipline, we encourage researchers and practitioners to
provide feedback. We will update this document regularly.

    <title>A machine learning methodology for real-time forecasting of the
  2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak using Internet searches, news alerts, and
  estimates from mechanistic models</title>
    <summary>  We present a timely and novel methodology that combines disease estimates
from mechanistic models with digital traces, via interpretable machine-learning
methodologies, to reliably forecast COVID-19 activity in Chinese provinces in
real-time. Specifically, our method is able to produce stable and accurate
forecasts 2 days ahead of current time, and uses as inputs (a) official health
reports from Chinese Center Disease for Control and Prevention (China CDC), (b)
COVID-19-related internet search activity from Baidu, (c) news media activity
reported by Media Cloud, and (d) daily forecasts of COVID-19 activity from
GLEAM, an agent-based mechanistic model. Our machine-learning methodology uses
a clustering technique that enables the exploitation of geo-spatial
synchronicities of COVID-19 activity across Chinese provinces, and a data
augmentation technique to deal with the small number of historical disease
activity observations, characteristic of emerging outbreaks. Our model's
predictive power outperforms a collection of baseline models in 27 out of the
32 Chinese provinces, and could be easily extended to other geographies
currently affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to help decision makers.

    <title>A simulation of a COVID-19 epidemic based on a deterministic SEIR model</title>
    <summary>  An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy
with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the
infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may
ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the
epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead
individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of
values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31)
approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3
initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of
lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7
million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period
providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection
period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the
reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is
0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed.
However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If
approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times
more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax
these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the
incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period
(13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times
more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination
of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the
epidemic.

    <title>Exploratory Analysis of Covid-19 Tweets using Topic Modeling, UMAP, and
  DiGraphs</title>
    <summary>  This paper illustrates five different techniques to assess the
distinctiveness of topics, key terms and features, speed of information
dissemination, and network behaviors for Covid19 tweets. First, we use pattern
matching and second, topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
to generate twenty different topics that discuss case spread, healthcare
workers, and personal protective equipment (PPE). One topic specific to U.S.
cases would start to uptick immediately after live White House Coronavirus Task
Force briefings, implying that many Twitter users are paying attention to
government announcements. We contribute machine learning methods not previously
reported in the Covid19 Twitter literature. This includes our third method,
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), that identifies unique
clustering-behavior of distinct topics to improve our understanding of
important themes in the corpus and help assess the quality of generated topics.
Fourth, we calculated retweeting times to understand how fast information about
Covid19 propagates on Twitter. Our analysis indicates that the median
retweeting time of Covid19 for a sample corpus in March 2020 was 2.87 hours,
approximately 50 minutes faster than repostings from Chinese social media about
H7N9 in March 2013. Lastly, we sought to understand retweet cascades, by
visualizing the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As
the time to retweet increases, the density of connections also increase where
in our sample, we found distinct users dominating the attention of Covid19
retweeters. One of the simplest highlights of this analysis is that early-stage
descriptive methods like regular expressions can successfully identify
high-level themes which were consistently verified as important through every
subsequent analysis.

    <title>How Reliable is Smartphone-based Electronic Contact Tracing for
  COVID-19?</title>
    <summary>  Smartphone-based electronic contact tracing is currently considered an
essential tool towards easing lockdowns, curfews, and shelter-in-place orders
issued by most governments around the world in response to the 2020 novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) crisis. While the focus on developing smartphone-based
contact tracing applications or apps has been on privacy concerns stemming from
the use of such apps, an important question that has not received sufficient
attention is: How reliable will such smartphone-based electronic contact
tracing be?
  This is a technical question related to how two smartphones reliably register
their mutual proximity. Here, we examine in detail the technical prerequisites
required for effective smartphone-based contact tracing. The underlying
mechanism that any contact tracing app relies on is called Neighbor Discovery
(ND), which involves smartphones transmitting and scanning for Bluetooth
signals to record their mutual presence whenever they are in close proximity.
The hardware support and the software protocols used for ND in smartphones,
however, were not designed for reliable contact tracing. In this paper, we
quantitatively evaluate how reliably can smartphones do contact tracing. Our
results point towards the design of a wearable solution for contact tracing
that can overcome the shortcomings of a smartphone-based solution to provide
more reliable and accurate contact tracing. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study that quantifies, both, the suitability and also the
drawbacks of smartphone-based contact tracing. Further, our results can be used
to parameterize a ND protocol to maximize the reliability of any contact
tracing app that uses it.

    <title>The Framework for the Prediction of the Critical Turning Period for
  Outbreak of COVID-19 Spread in China based on the iSEIR Model</title>
    <summary>  The goal of this study is to establish a general framework for predicting the
so-called critical Turning Period in an infectious disease epidemic such as the
COVID-19 outbreak in China early this year. This framework enabled a timely
prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic and
informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to
control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on
turning period for the world's current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual
Susceptible-Exposed- Infective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of
differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed
daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to
the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases
dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated
model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in
Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to
be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals,
essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare
aftermath planning. Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on
flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the Lockdown and Isolation
Control Program in Wuhan since January 23, 2020. The Wuhan experience provides
an exemplary lesson for the whole world to learn in combating COVID-19.

    <title>The effect of anti-COVID-19 policies to the evolution of the disease: A
  complex network analysis to the successful case of Greece</title>
    <summary>  Within the context that Greece promises a success story in the fight against
the disease, this paper proposes a novel method to study the evolution of the
Greek COVID-19 infection-curve in relation to the anti-COVID-19 policies
applied to control the pandemic. Based on the ongoing spreading of COVID-19 and
the insufficient data for applying classic time-series approaches, the analysis
builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID-19
infection-curve as a complex network. By using the modularity optimization
algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining
periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods reveal
a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting
with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern
intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending
up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek
COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also
illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes,
implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and
high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The
overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel
method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which
allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better
forecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices
and management that may help other countries improve their performance in the
war against COVID-19.

    <title>A reaction-diffusion system to better comprehend the unlockdown:
  Application of SEIR-type model with diffusion to the spatial spread of
  COVID-19 in France</title>
    <summary>  A reaction-diffusion model was developed describing the spread of the
COVID-19 virus considering the mean daily movement of susceptible, exposed and
asymptomatic individuals. The model was calibrated using data on the confirmed
infection and death from France as well as their initial spatial distribution.
First, the system of partial differential equations is studied, then the basic
reproduction number, R0 is derived. Second, numerical simulations, based on a
combination of level-set and finite differences, shown the spatial spread of
COVID-19 from March 16 to June 16. Finally, scenarios of unlockdown are
compared according to variation of distancing, or partially spatial lockdown.

    <title>Estimation of the actual disease occurrence based on official case
  numbers during a COVID outbreak in Germany 2020</title>
    <summary>  Since the beginning of March 2020, the cumulative numbers of cases of
infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Germany have been reported
on a daily basis. The reports originate from national laws, according to which
positive test findings must be submitted to the Federal Health Authorities, the
Robert Koch Institute, via the local health authorities. Since an enormous
number of unreported cases can be expected, the question of how widespread the
disease has been in the population cannot be answered based on these
administrative reports. Using mathematical modeling, however, estimates can be
made. These estimates indicate that the small numbers of diagnostic tests
carried out at the beginning of the outbreak overlooked considerable parts of
the infection. In order to cover the initial phase of future waves of the
disease, wide-spread and comprehensive tests are recommended.

    <title>Using Bayesian Optimization to Accelerate Virtual Screening for the
  Discovery of Therapeutics Appropriate for Repurposing for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The novel Wuhan coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has brought almost
unprecedented effects for a non-wartime setting, hitting social, economic and
health systems hard.~ Being able to bring to bear pharmaceutical interventions
to counteract its effects will represent a major turning point in the fight to
turn the tides in this ongoing battle.~ Recently, the World's most powerful
supercomputer, SUMMIT, was used to identify existing small molecule
pharmaceuticals which may have the desired activity against SARS-CoV-2 through
a high throughput virtual screening approach. In this communication, we
demonstrate how the use of Bayesian optimization can provide a valuable service
for the prioritisation of these calculations, leading to the accelerated
identification of high-performing candidates, and thus expanding the scope of
the utility of HPC systems for time critical screening

    <title>Assessing the impacts of mutations to the structure of COVID-19 spike
  protein via sequential Monte Carlo</title>
    <summary>  Proteins play a key role in facilitating the infectiousness of the 2019 novel
coronavirus. A specific spike protein enables this virus to bind to human
cells, and a thorough understanding of its 3-dimensional structure is therefore
critical for developing effective therapeutic interventions. However, its
structure may continue to evolve over time as a result of mutations. In this
paper, we use a data science perspective to study the potential structural
impacts due to ongoing mutations in its amino acid sequence. To do so, we
identify a key segment of the protein and apply a sequential Monte Carlo
sampling method to detect possible changes to the space of low-energy
conformations for different amino acid sequences. Such computational approaches
can further our understanding of this protein structure and complement
laboratory efforts.

    <title>Detection of Bio-aerosols and COVID-19 Equivalent Particles Via On-chip
  Mid Infrared Photonic Spectroscopy</title>
    <summary>  We propose an on-chip mid-infrared (MIR) photonic spectroscopy platform for
aerosol characterization to obtain highly discriminatory information on the
chemistry of aerosol particles. Sensing of aerosols is crucial for various
environmental, climactic, warfare threat detection, and pulmonary healthcare
applications. Further, there are a number of unintended situations for
potential exposure to bioaerosols such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. For
instance, the current pandemic scenario of COVID-19 occurring across the world.
Currently, chemical characterization of aerosols is performed using FTIR
spectroscopy yielding chemical fingerprinting because most of the vibrational
and rotational transitions of chemical molecules fall in the MIR range; and
Raman spectroscopy. Both techniques use free space bench-top geometries. Here,
we propose miniaturized on-chip MIR photonics-based aerosol spectroscopy
consisting of a broadband spiral-waveguide sensor that significantly enhances
particle-light interaction to improve sensitivity. The spiral waveguides are
made of a chalcogenide glass material (Ge23Sb7S70) which shows a broad
transparency over IR range. We demonstrate the sensing of N-methyl
aniline-based aerosol particles with the device. We anticipate that the sensor
will readily complement existing photonic resonator-based particle sizing and
counting techniques to develop a unified framework for on-chip integrated
photonic aerosol spectroscopy.

    <title>Predicting the ultimate outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy</title>
    <summary>  During the COVID-19 outbreak, it is essential to monitor the effectiveness of
measures taken by governments on the course of the epidemic. Here we show that
there is already a sufficient amount of data collected in Italy to predict the
outcome of the process. We show that using the proper metric, the data from
Hubei Province and Italy has striking similarity, which enables us to calculate
the expected number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths by the end of
the process. Our predictions will improve as new data points are generated day
by day, which can help to make further public decisions. The method is based on
the data analysis of logistic growth equations describing the process on the
macroscopic level. At the time of writing of the first version, the number of
fatalities in Italy was expected to be 6000, and the predicted end of the
crisis was April 15, 2020. In this new version, we discuss what changed in the
two weeks which passed since then. The trend changed drastically on March 17,
2020, when the Italian health system reached its capacity limit. Without this
limit, probably 3500 more people would have died. Instead, due to the
limitations, 17.000 people are expected to die now, which is a five-fold
increase. The predicted end of the crisis now shifted to May 8, 2020.

    <title>Bi-stability of SUDR+K model of epidemics and test kits applied to
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Motivated with various responses of world governments to COVID-19, here we
develop a toy model of the dependence epidemics spreading on the availability
of tests for disease. Our model, that we call SUDR+K, is based on usual SIR
model, but it splits the total fraction of infected individuals into two
components: those that are undetected and those that are detected through
tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate
from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected
individuals. Strikingly we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a
giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that
the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the
rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that
the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the
form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested
and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing
activity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially
keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change in rate of
testing can increase or decrease the size of the whole epidemics of various
orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing
epidemics, we would gladly collaborate with field epidemiologists in order to
develop quantitative models of testing process.

    <title>Comparative analysis of the diffusion of Covid-19 infection in different
  countries</title>
    <summary>  The sudden spread of Covid-19 outside China has pushed on March 11 the World
Health Organization to acknowledge the ongoing outbreak as a pandemic. It is
crucial in this phase to understand what should countries which presently lag
behind in the spread of the infection learn from countries where the infection
spread earlier. The choice of this work is to prefer timeliness to
comprehensiveness. By adopting a purely empirical approach, we will limit
ourselves to identifying different phases in the plots of different countries,
based on their different functional behaviour, and to make a comparative
analysis. The comparative analysis of the registered cases curves highlights
remarkable similarities, especially among Western countries, together with some
minor but crucial differences. We highlight how timeliness can largely reduce
the size of the individual national outbreaks, ultimately limiting the final
death toll. Our data suggest that Western governments have not unfortunately
shown the capability to anticipate their decisions, based on the experience of
countries hit earlier by the outbreak.

    <title>On Fast Multi-Shot COVID-19 Interventions for Post Lock-Down Mitigation</title>
    <summary>  Fast intermittent lock-down intervals with regular period are suggested as a
COVID-19 exit strategy from the widely adopted policy of total lock-down. Many
proposed exit strategies have risks and uncertainties which could lead to a
second wave of infection [1,2]. We demonstrate that our proposed policies have
the potential to be a method of virus suppression, while at the same time
allowing continued (albeit reduced) economic activity. Furthermore, these
policies, while not eliminating the virus, can nevertheless be sustained over
long periods of time, until a vaccine or treatment becomes available. The
robustness of these policies stems from the fact that they are open loop
methods; namely, lock-down periods are not triggered by measurements --
inevitably uncertain and delayed -- over short time scales such as hospital
admissions, but rather are driven by predictable, high-frequency, periodic
triggers in- and out- of lock-down. A slow and inherently robust outer
supervisory feedback loop, based on measurements over longer time scales, is
used to tune the parameters of the mitigation strategy. These methods can act
alone, or can be used in combination with other mitigation strategies, to
provide additional levels of effectiveness in their operation.

    <title>Personalized workflow to identify optimal T-cell epitopes for
  peptide-based vaccines against COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Traditional vaccines against viruses are designed to target their surface
proteins, i.e., antigens, which can trigger the immune system to produce
specific antibodies to capture and neutralize the viruses. However, viruses
often evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid
recognition by the antibodies (antigenic drift). This limitation of the
antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity,
which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented on
virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a
virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may
work effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose a
personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based on
the HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person. Specifically,
our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and then
predicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely to
trigger responses from the person T cells. We applied the workflow to identify
T-cell epitopes for the SARS-COV-2 virus, which has caused the recent COVID-19
pandemic in more than 100 countries across the globe.

    <title>Short-term predictions of country-specific Covid-19 infection rates
  based on power law scaling exponents</title>
    <summary>  The number of corona virus (COVID-19) infections grows worldwide. In order to
create short term predictions to prepare for the extent of the global pandemic
we analyze infection data from the top 25 affected countries. It is shown that
all country-specific infection rates follow a power law growth behavior and the
scaling exponents per country are calculated. We find two different growth
patterns: either steady power law growth from the very beginning with moderate
scaling exponents of 3-5 or explosive power law growth with dramatic scaling
exponents of 8-11. In the case of the USA we even find an exponent of 16.59. By
means of data analysis we confirm that instituting strict measures of
lock-downs combined with a strong adherence by the population are effective
means to bring the growth rates down. While many countries have instituted
measures there are only three countries (Denmark, Norway, and South Korea) so
far where such lock-downs led to a significant reduction of the growth rate. In
the case of Denmark we calculate the reduction of the scaling exponents to move
from 6.82 to 1.47.

    <title>The fractal time growth of COVID-19 pandemic: an accurate self-similar
  model, and urgent conclusions</title>
    <summary>  Current available data of the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has
been analyzed using dimensional analysis and self-similarity hypotheses. We
show that the time series of infected population and deaths of the most
impacted and unprepared countries exhibits an asymptotic power law behavior,
compatible with the propagation of a signal in a fractal network. We propose a
model which predicts an asymptotically self-similar expansion of deaths in time
before containment, and the final death toll under total containment measures,
as a function of the delay in taking those measures after the expansion is
observed. The physics of the model resembles the expansion of a flame in a
homogeneous domain with a fractal dimension 3.75. After containment measures
are taken, the natural fractal structure of the network is drastically altered
and a secondary evolution is observed. This evolution, akin to the homogeneous
combustion in a static isolated enclosure with a final quenching, has a
characteristic time of 20.1 days, according to available data of the pandemic
behavior in China. The proposed model is remarkably consistent with available
data, which supports the simplifying hypotheses made in the model. A universal
formulation for a quarantine as a function of that delay is also proposed.

    <title>Estimating the infection horizon of COVID-19 in eight countries with a
  data-driven approach</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all countries of the world producing a
substantial number of fatalities accompanied by a major disruption in their
social, financial, and educational organization. The strict disciplinary
measures implemented by China were very effective and thus were subsequently
adopted by most world countries to various degrees. The infection duration and
number of infected persons are of critical importance for the battle against
the pandemic. We use the quantitative landscape of the disease spreading in
China as a benchmark and utilize infection data from eight countries to
estimate the complete evolution of the infection in each of these countries.
The analysis predicts successfully both the expected number of daily infections
per country and, perhaps more importantly, the duration of the epidemic in each
country. Our quantitative approach is based on a Gaussian spreading hypothesis
that is shown to arise as a result of imposed measures in a simple dynamical
infection model. This may have consequences and shed light in the efficiency of
policies once the phenomenon is over.

    <title>Generating Similarity Map for COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics with
  Topological Autoencoder</title>
    <summary>  At the beginning of 2020 the world has seen the initial outbreak of COVID-19,
a disease caused by SARS-CoV2 virus in China. The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared this disease as a pandemic on March 11 2020. As the disease
spread globally, it becomes difficult to tract the transmission dynamics of
this disease in all countries, as they may differ in geographical, demographic
and strategical aspects. In this short note, the author proposes the
utilization of a type of neural network to generate a global topological map
for these dynamics, in which countries that share similar dynamics are mapped
adjacently, while countries with significantly different dynamics are mapped
far from each other. The author believes that this kind of topological map can
be useful for further analyzing and comparing the correlation between the
diseases dynamics with strategies to mitigate this global crisis in an
intuitive manner. Some initial experiments with with time series of patients
numbers in more than 240 countries are explained in this note.

    <title>Accounting for Symptomatic and Asymptomatic in a SEIR-type model of
  COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  A mathematical model was developed describing the dynamic of the COVID-19
virus over a population considering that the infected can either be symptomatic
or not. The model was calibrated using data on the confirmed cases and death
from several countries like France, Philippines, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom,
China, and the USA. First, we derived the basic reproduction number,
$\mathcal{R}_0$, and estimated the effective reproduction $\mathcal{R}_{\rm
eff}$ for each country. Second, we were interested in the merits of
interventions, either by distancing or by treatment. Results revealed that
total and partial containment is effective in reducing the transmission.
However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (104 days for
France). By setting the end of intervention as the day when hospital capacity
is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up
to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results
pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after
containment. Therefore, testing and isolation are necessary to stop the
disease.

    <title>Time, Space and Social Interactions: Exit Mechanisms for the Covid-19
  Epidemics</title>
    <summary>  We develop a minimalist compartmental model to study the impact of mobility
restrictions in Italy during the Covid-19 outbreak. We show that an early
lockdown shifts the epidemic in time, while that beyond a critical value of the
lockdown strength, the epidemic tend to restart after lifting the restrictions.
As a consequence, specific mitigation strategies must be introduced. We
characterize the relative importance of different broad strategies by
accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and
demography. First, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative
entities, in which social interactions between age classs occur. Due to the
sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix, once started the epidemics tend
to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of solutions
specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Second, we show that
social contacts between age classes play a fundamental role and that measures
which take into account the age structure of the population can provide a
significant contribution to mitigate the rebound effects. Our model is general,
and while it does not analyze specific mitigation strategies, it highlights the
relevance of some key parameters on non-pharmaceutical mitigation mechanisms
for the epidemics.

    <title>Using random testing to manage a safe exit from the COVID-19 lockdown</title>
    <summary>  We argue that frequent sampling of the fraction of infected people (either by
random testing or by analysis of sewage water), is central to managing the
COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures in real time the key variable
controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare
system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes
will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow
informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with
much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time
assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates.
  Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous
population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested
people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current
fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to
real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still
higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in
spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in
place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is
still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of
restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is
demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where
the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.

    <title>A note on blind contact tracing at scale with applications to the
  COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights the utility of contact tracing, when
combined with case isolation and social distancing, as an important tool for
mitigating the spread of a disease [1]. Contact tracing provides a mechanism of
identifying individuals with a high likelihood of previous exposure to a
contagious disease, allowing additional precautions to be put in place to
prevent continued transmission. Here we consider a cryptographic approach to
contact tracing based on secure two-party computation (2PC). We begin by
considering the problem of comparing a set of location histories held by two
parties to determine whether they have come within some threshold distance
while at the same time maintaining the privacy of the location histories. We
propose a solution to this problem using pre-shared keys, adapted from an
equality testing protocol due to Ishai et al [2]. We discuss how this protocol
can be used to maintain privacy within practical contact tracing scenarios,
including both app-based approaches and approaches which leverage location
history held by telecoms and internet service providers. We examine the
efficiency of this approach and show that existing infrastructure is sufficient
to support anonymised contact tracing at a national level.

    <title>The Effect of Population Size for Pathogen Transmission on Prediction of
  COVID-19 Pandemic Spread</title>
    <summary>  Extreme public health interventions play a critical role in mitigating the
local and global prevalence and pandemic potential of COVID-19. Here, we use
population size for pathogen transmission to measure the intensity of public
health interventions, which is a key characteristic variable for nowcasting and
forecasting of the epidemic. By formulating a hidden Markov dynamic system and
using nonlinear filtering theory, we have developed a stochastic epidemic
dynamic model under public health interventions. The model parameters and
states are estimated in time from internationally available public data by
combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter.
Moreover, we consider the computability of the population size and provide its
selection criterion. We estimate the mean of the basic reproductive number of
China and the rest of the globe except China (GEC) to be 2.46 (95% CI:
2.41-2.51) and 3.64 (95% CI: (3.55-3.72), respectively. We infer that the
number of latent infections of GEC is about 7.47*10^5 (95% CI:
7.32*10^5-7.62*10^5) as of April 2, 2020. We predict that the peak of
infections in hospitals of GEC may reach 3.00*10^6 on the present trajectory,
i.e., if the population size for pathogen transmission and epidemic parameters
remains unchanged. If the control intensity is strengthened, e.g., 50%
reduction or 75% reduction of the population size for pathogen transmission,
the peak would decline to 1.84*10^6, 1.27*10^6, respectively.

    <title>Examining Lead-Lag Relationships In-Depth, With Focus On FX Market As
  Covid-19 Crises Unfolds</title>
    <summary>  The lead-lag relationship plays a vital role in financial markets. It is the
phenomenon where a certain price-series lags behind and partially replicates
the movement of leading time-series. The present research proposes a new
technique which helps better identify the lead-lag relationship empirically.
Apart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also gives a
measure for adjudging closeness between financial time-series. Also, the
proposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic
Programming technique for finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it
retains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as loose
metric. Tests are performed on Synthetic Time Series (STS) with known lead-lag
relationship and comparisons are done with other state-of-the-art models on the
basis of significance and forecastability. The proposed technique gives the
best results in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically
significant, and its forecasts are closest to the target values. Then, we use
the measure to study the topology evolution of the Foreign Exchange market, as
the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Here, we study the FX currency prices of 29
prominent countries of the world. It is observed that as the crises unfold, all
the currencies become strongly interlinked to each other. Also, USA Dollar
starts playing even more central role in the FX market. Finally, we mention
several other application areas of the proposed technique for designing
intelligent systems.

    <title>Contact Tracing: a game of big numbers in the time of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  One of the more widely advocated solutions to slowing down the spread of
COVID-19 has been automated contact tracing. Since proximity data can be
collected by personal mobile devices, the natural proposal has been to use this
for contact tracing as this provides a major gain over a manual implementation.
In this work, we study the characteristics of automated contact tracing and its
effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of
SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for
automated contact tracing to work for the current pandemic. We display the
vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequately sample the population, which
results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with
infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a
significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold.
We conclude that a strong reliance on contact tracing to contain the spread of
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can lead to the potential danger of allowing the
pandemic to spread unchecked. A carefully thought out strategy for controlling
the spread of the pandemic along with automated contact tracing can lead to an
optimal solution.

    <title>Inferring epidemic parameters for COVID-19 from fatality counts in
  Mumbai</title>
    <summary>  Epidemic parameters are estimated through Bayesian inference using the daily
fatality counts in Mumbai during the period from March 31 to April 14. A
doubling time of 5.5 days (median with 95% CrI of 4.6-6.9 days) is observed. In
the SEIR model this gives the basic reproduction rate R_0 of 3.4 (median with
95% CrI of 2.4-4.8). Using as input the infection fatality rate and the
interval between infection and death, the number of infections in Mumbai is
inferred. It is found that the ratio of the number of test positives to the
total infections is 0.13\% (median), implying that tests are currently finding
1 out of 750 cases of infection. After correcting for different testing rates,
this result is compatible with a measurement of the ratio made recently via
serological testing in the USA. From the estimates of the number of infections
we infer that the first COVID-19 cases were seeded in Mumbai between late
December 2019 and early February 2020. provided the doubling times remained
unchanged since then. We remark on some public health implications if the rate
of growth cannot be controlled in about a week.

    <title>Second waves, social distancing, and the spread of COVID-19 across
  America</title>
    <summary>  We recently described a dynamic causal model of a COVID-19 outbreak within a
single region. Here, we combine several of these (epidemic) models to create a
(pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave
of new cases that may result from loss of immunity--and the exchange of people
between regions--and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different
strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing
strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of
the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated
using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the
parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State
and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we
identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the
initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing
posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of
different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and
demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest
that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that
underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.

    <title>Short-term forecasts of COVID-19 spread across Indian states until 1 May
  2020</title>
    <summary>  The very first case of corona-virus illness was recorded on 30 January 2020,
in India and the number of infected cases, including the death toll, continues
to rise. In this paper, we present short-term forecasts of COVID-19 for 28
Indian states and five union territories using real-time data from 30 January
to 21 April 2020. Applying Holt's second-order exponential smoothing method and
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, we generate 10-day
ahead forecasts of the likely number of infected cases and deaths in India for
22 April to 1 May 2020. Our results show that the number of cumulative cases in
India will rise to 36335.63 [PI 95% (30884.56, 42918.87)], concurrently the
number of deaths may increase to 1099.38 [PI 95% (959.77, 1553.76)] by 1 May
2020. Further, we have divided the country into severity zones based on the
cumulative cases. According to this analysis, Maharashtra is likely to be the
most affected states with around 9787.24 [PI 95% (6949.81, 13757.06)]
cumulative cases by 1 May 2020. However, Kerala and Karnataka are likely to
shift from the red zone (i.e. highly affected) to the lesser affected region.
On the other hand, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh will move to the red zone. These
results mark the states where lockdown by 3 May 2020, can be loosened.

    <title>COVID-19 and the difficulty of inferring epidemiological parameters from
  clinical data</title>
    <summary>  Knowing the infection fatality ratio (IFR) is of crucial importance for
evidence-based epidemic management: for immediate planning; for balancing the
life years saved against the life years lost due to the consequences of
management; and for evaluating the ethical issues associated with the tacit
willingness to pay substantially more for life years lost to the epidemic, than
for those to other diseases. Against this background Verity et al. (2020,
Lancet Infections Diseases) have rapidly assembled case data and used
statistical modelling to infer the IFR for COVID-19. We have attempted an
in-depth statistical review of their approach, to identify to what extent the
data are sufficiently informative about the IFR to play a greater role than the
modelling assumptions, and have tried to identify those assumptions that appear
to play a key role. Given the difficulties with other data sources, we provide
a crude alternative analysis based on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship data and
case data from China, and argue that, given the data problems, modelling of
clinical data to obtain the IFR can only be a stop-gap measure. What is needed
is near direct measurement of epidemic size by PCR and/or antibody testing of
random samples of the at risk population.

    <title>The first 100 days: modeling the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  A simple analytical model for modeling the evolution of the 2020 COVID-19
pandemic is presented. The model is based on the numerical solution of the
widely used Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) populations model for
describing epidemics. We consider an expanded version of the original
Kermack-McKendrick model, which includes a decaying value of the parameter
$\beta$ (the effective contact rate) due to externally imposed conditions, to
which we refer as the forced-SIR (FSIR) model. We introduce an approximate
analytical solution to the differential equations that represent the FSIR model
which gives very reasonable fits to real data for a number of countries over a
period of 100 days (from the first onset of exponential increase, in China).
The proposed model contains 3 adjustable parameters which are obtained by
fitting actual data (up to April 28, 2020). We analyze these results to infer
the physical meaning of the parameters involved. We use the model to make
predictions about the total expected number of infections in each country as
well as the date when the number of infections will have reached 99% of this
total. We also compare key findings of the model with recently reported results
on the high contagiousness and rapid spread of the disease.

    <title>Heterogeneous social interactions and the COVID-19 lockdown outcome in a
  multi-group SEIR model</title>
    <summary>  We study variants of the SEIR model for interpreting some qualitative
features of the statistics of the Covid-19 epidemic in France. Standard SEIR
models distinguish essentially two regimes: either the disease is controlled
and the number of infected people rapidly decreases, or the disease spreads and
contaminates a significant fraction of the population until herd immunity is
achieved. After lockdown, at first sight it seems that social distancing is not
enough to control the outbreak. We discuss here a possible explanation, namely
that the lockdown is creating social heterogeneity: even if a large majority of
the population complies with the lockdown rules, a small fraction of the
population still has to maintain a normal or high level of social interactions,
such as health workers, providers of essential services, etc. This results in
an apparent high level of epidemic propagation as measured through
re-estimations of the basic reproduction ratio. However, these measures are
limited to averages, while variance inside the population plays an essential
role on the peak and the size of the epidemic outbreak and tends to lower these
two indicators. We provide theoretical and numerical results to sustain such a
view.

    <title>COVID-19 societal response captured by seismic noise in China and Italy</title>
    <summary>  Seismic noise with frequencies above 1 Hz is often called cultural noise and
is generally correlated quite well with human activities. Recently, cities in
mainland China and Italy imposed lockdown restrictions in response to COVID-19,
which gave us an unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between
seismic noise above 1 Hz and human activities. Using seismic records from
stations in China and Italy, we show that seismic noise above 1 Hz was
primarily generated by the local transportation systems. The lockdown of the
cities and the imposition of travel restrictions led to a ~4-12 dB energy
decrease in seismic noise in mainland China. Data also show that different
Chinese cities experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise,
related to differences in local response to the epidemic. In contrast, there
was only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of seismic noise in Italy, after the country
was put under a lockdown. The noise data indicate that traffic flow did not
decrease as much in Italy, but show how different cities reacted distinctly to
the lockdown conditions.

    <title>Exponential-growth prediction bias and compliance with safety measures
  in the times of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We conduct a unique, Amazon MTurk-based global experiment to investigate the
importance of an exponential-growth prediction bias (EGPB) in understanding why
the COVID-19 outbreak has exploded. The scientific basis for our inquiry is the
well-established fact that disease spread, especially in the initial stages,
follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a
widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. We define
prediction bias as the systematic error arising from faulty prediction of the
number of cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data
on the same. Our design permits us to identify the root of this
under-prediction as an EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate
the speed at which exponential processes unfold. Our data reveals that the
"degree of convexity" reflected in the predicted path of the disease is
significantly and substantially lower than the actual path. The bias is
significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative
to those at an early stage of disease progression. We find that individuals who
exhibit EGPB are also more likely to reveal markedly reduced compliance with
the WHO-recommended safety measures, find general violations of safety
protocols less alarming, and show greater faith in their government's actions.
A simple behavioral nudge which shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as
opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. Clear communication of risk via raw
numbers could increase accuracy of risk perception, in turn facilitating
compliance with suggested protective behaviors.

of the measures has crucial policy-making implications. Using publicly
available data for the pandemic progression in Italy, we quantitatively assess
the effect of the intervention time on the pandemic expansion, with a
methodology that combines a generalized
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model together with statistical
learning methods. The modeling shows that the lockdown has strongly deviated
the pandemic trajectory in Italy. However, the difference between the forecasts
and real data up to 20 April 2020 can be explained only by the existence of a
time lag between the actual issuance date and the full effect of the measures.
To understand the relative importance of intervention with respect to other
factors, a thorough uncertainty quantification of the model predictions is
performed. Global sensitivity indices show that the the time of intervention is
4 times more relevant than quarantine, and eight times more important than
intrinsic features of the pandemic such as protection and infection rates. The
relevance of their interactions is also quantified and studied.

    <title>Using posterior predictive distributions to analyse epidemic models:
  COVID-19 in Mexico City</title>
    <summary>  Epidemiological models contain a set of parameters that must be adjusted
based on available observations. Once a model has been calibrated, it can be
used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency
plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators for such predictions.
However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of
parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from
such models will vary widely, depending on the particular parameter values
employed within the range that give a good fit. When data are poor or
incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem
is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full
range of parameter estimates contained in the posterior distribution to adjust
for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given the epidemiological
model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior
distribution of model parameters to generate all possible epidemiological
curves via the posterior predictive distribution. From the envelope of all
curves one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of
implementing contingency plans according to this assessment. We apply this
approach to the potential evolution of COVID-19 in Mexico City and assess
whether contingency plans are being successful and whether the epidemiological
curve has flattened.

    <title>Using Computer Vision to enhance Safety of Workforce in Manufacturing in
  a Post COVID World</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments across the world to impose lockdowns
to prevent virus transmissions. This resulted in the shutdown of all economic
activity and accordingly the production at manufacturing plants across most
sectors was halted. While there is an urgency to resume production, there is an
even greater need to ensure the safety of the workforce at the plant site.
Reports indicate that maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks
while at work clearly reduces the risk of transmission. We decided to use
computer vision on CCTV feeds to monitor worker activity and detect violations
which trigger real time voice alerts on the shop floor. This paper describes an
efficient and economic approach of using AI to create a safe environment in a
manufacturing setup. We demonstrate our approach to build a robust social
distancing measurement algorithm using a mix of modern-day deep learning and
classic projective geometry techniques. We have deployed our solution at
manufacturing plants across the Aditya Birla Group (ABG). We have also
described our face mask detection approach which provides a high accuracy
across a range of customized masks.

    <title>Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Internet latency: a large-scale
  study</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed the way of living of billions of
people in a very short time frame. In this paper, we evaluate the impact on the
Internet latency caused by the increased amount of human activities that are
carried out on-line. The study focuses on Italy, which experienced significant
restrictions imposed by local authorities, but results about Spain, France,
Germany, Sweden, and the whole Europe are also included. The analysis of a
large set of measurements shows that the impact on the network is significant,
especially in terms of increased variability of latency. In Italy we observed
that the standard deviation of the additional delay -- the additional time with
respect to the minimum for a given path -- during lockdown is ~3-6 times as
much as the value before the pandemic. Similarly, packet loss is ~1.4-7 times
as much as before the pandemic. The impact is not negligible also for the other
countries and for the whole Europe, but with different levels and distinct
patterns.

    <title>An Investigation of COVID-19 Spreading Factors with Explainable AI
  Techniques</title>
    <summary>  Since COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019, various public health
interventions have been implemented across the world. As different measures are
implemented at different countries at different times, we conduct an assessment
of the relative effectiveness of the measures implemented in 18 countries and
regions using data from 22/01/2020 to 02/04/2020. We compute the top one and
two measures that are most effective for the countries and regions studied
during the period. Two Explainable AI techniques, SHAP and ECPI, are used in
our study; such that we construct (machine learning) models for predicting the
instantaneous reproduction number ($R_t$) and use the models as surrogates to
the real world and inputs that the greatest influence to our models are seen as
measures that are most effective. Across-the-board, city lockdown and contact
tracing are the two most effective measures. For ensuring $R_t&lt;1$, public
wearing face masks is also important. Mass testing alone is not the most
effective measure although when paired with other measures, it can be
effective. Warm temperature helps for reducing the transmission.

    <title>Bluetooth Smartphone Apps: Are they the most private and effective
  solution for COVID-19 contact tracing?</title>
    <summary>  Many digital solutions mainly involving Bluetooth technology are being
proposed for Contact Tracing Apps (CTA) to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Concerns have been raised regarding privacy, consent, uptake required in a
given population, and the degree to which use of CTAs can impact individual
behaviours. However, very few groups have taken a holistic approach and
presented a combined solution. None has presented their CTA in such a way as to
ensure that even the most suggestible member of our community does not become
complacent and assume that CTA operates as an invisible shield, making us and
our families impenetrable or immune to the disease. We propose to build on some
of the digital solutions already under development that, with addition of a
Bayesian model that predicts likelihood for infection supplemented by
traditional symptom and contact tracing, that can enable us to reach 90% of a
population. When combined with an effective communication strategy and social
distancing, we believe solutions like the one proposed here can have a very
beneficial effect on containing the spread of this pandemic.

    <title>Emerging Polynomial Growth Trends in COVID-19 Pandemic Data and Their
  Reconciliation with Compartment Based Models</title>
    <summary>  We study the reported data from the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in January -
May 2020 in 119 countries. We observe that the time series of active cases in
individual countries (the difference of the total number of confirmed
infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered
cases) display a strong agreement with polynomial growth and at a later
epidemic stage also with a combined polynomial growth with exponential decay.
Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical
models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing
the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an
algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number $R_0$ as $T_M/t$, where
$T_M$ is a constant and $t$ is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show
how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic
data and estimate some epidemic parameters. Note that although the model shows
a good agreement with the reported data we do not make any claims about the
real size of the pandemics as the relation of the observed reported data to the
total number of infected in the population is still unknown.

    <title>Remarks on a data-driven model for predicting the course of COVID-19
  epidemic</title>
    <summary>  Norden E. Huang, Fangli Qiao and Ka Kit Tung presented a data-driven model
for the COVID-19 epidemic in which the relevant functions depend on a set of
seven parameters obtained from a statistical analysis of the available data.
These parameters are not independent, they are linked through a set of
relations the authors call Main Results which are validated by a statistical
analysis of the data. The parameters in questions and the relations between
them are not always explicitated by the authors. By given them here their
(simple) mathematical formulations all the relevant functions describing the
dynamic can be explicitely written down. All the explicit formulas follow from
the fact that the log of the number of infected, is a quadratic function of
time. The formulas presented here are not themselves approximations - but the
parameters they involve are of course statistical quantities derived from the
data. These formulas could maybe be of some use either to validate the data,
the model itself, to update the model or to find approximations to the relevant
quantities.

    <title>Quantifying the Immediate Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Scientists</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted the scientific enterprise,
but we lack empirical evidence on the nature and magnitude of these
disruptions. Here we report the results of a survey of approximately 4,500
Principal Investigators (PIs) at U.S.- and Europe-based research institutions.
Distributed in mid-April 2020, the survey solicited information about how
scientists' work changed from the onset of the pandemic, how their research
output might be affected in the near future, and a wide range of individuals'
characteristics. Scientists report a sharp decline in time spent on research on
average, but there is substantial heterogeneity with a significant share
reporting no change or even increases. Some of this heterogeneity is due to
field-specific differences, with laboratory-based fields being the most
negatively affected, and some is due to gender, with female scientists
reporting larger declines. However, among the individuals' characteristics
examined, the largest disruptions are connected to a usually unobserved
dimension: childcare. Reporting a young dependent is associated with declines
similar in magnitude to those reported by the laboratory-based fields and can
account for a significant fraction of gender differences. Amidst scarce
evidence about the role of parenting in scientists' work, these results
highlight the fundamental and heterogeneous ways this pandemic is affecting the
scientific workforce, and may have broad relevance for shaping responses to the
pandemic's effect on science and beyond.

    <title>Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in Brazil by a generalized SEIR model</title>
    <summary>  We shall apply a generalized SEIR model to study the outbreak of COVID-19 in
Brazil. In particular, we would like to explain the projections of the increase
in the level of infection over a long period of time, overlapping large local
outbreaks in the most populous states in the country. A time-dependent dynamic
SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during the outbreak in China was
used to analyses the time trajectories of infected, recovered, and deaths. The
model has parameters that vary with time and are fitted considering a nonlinear
least-squares method. The simulations starting from April 8, 2020, concluded
that the time for a peak in Brazil will be in July 21, 2020 with total
cumulative infected cases around 982K people; in addition, an estimated total
death case will reach to 192K in the end. Besides that, Brazil will reach a
peak in terms of daily new infected cases and death cases around the middle of
July with 50K cases of infected and almost 6.0K daily deaths.

    <title>Causal Impact of Masks, Policies, Behavior on Early Covid-19 Pandemic in
  the U.S</title>
    <summary>  This paper evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies, such as school,
business, and restaurant closures, adopted by the US states on the growth rates
of confirmed Covid-19 cases and social distancing behavior measured by Google
Mobility Reports, where we take into consideration of people's voluntarily
behavioral response to new information of transmission risks. Using the US
state-level data, our analysis finds that both policies and information on
transmission risks are important determinants of people's social distancing
behavior, and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of
observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our counterfactual experiments
indicate that removing all policies would have lead to 30 to 200 times more
additional cases by late May. Removing only the non-essential businesses
closures (while maintaining restrictions on movie theaters and restaurants)
would have increased the weekly growth rate of cases between -0.02 and 0.06 and
would have lead to -10% to 40% more cases by late May. Finally, nationally
mandating face masks for employees on April 1st would have reduced the case
growth rate by 0.1-0.25. This leads to 30% to 57% fewer reported cases by late
May, which translates into, roughly, 30-57 thousand saved lives.

    <title>Explaining the Initial Spread of COVID-19 using Mobile Positioning Data:
  a Case Study</title>
    <summary>  This work provides an analysis on the potential of aggregate and anonymised
mobility data from mobile phones to explain the recent COVID-19 outbreak in
Europe. The data were processed by the European Commission in collaboration
with EU Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to improve the quality of modelling and
forecasting for the pandemic at EU level. Connectivity matrices derived from
MNOs at EU scale can help the understanding of the initial dynamics of the
spread. This work is expected to provide input to epidemiological modelling in
informing policies on de-escalation of control measures and recovery.
Connectivity data between administrative areas can also be used to estimate
impacts and spread of future outbreaks. A case study of France shows that
mobility alone can explain from 52% up to 92% of the initial spread of the
virus, while there is no effect before the outbreak, and has a slow decay
effect after lockdown measures are effective. It also emerges that internal
mobility is more important than mobility across geographical departments.

    <title>Discussing Privacy and Surveillance on Twitter: A Case Study of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Technology is uniquely positioned to help us analyze large amounts of
information to provide valuable insight during widespread public health
concerns, like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, information technology
companies like Apple and Google have recently launched tools for contact
tracing-the ability to process location data to determine the people who have
been in contact with a possible patient, in order to contain the spread of the
virus. While China and Singapore have successfully led the effort, more and
more countries are now implementing such surveillance systems, raising
potential privacy concerns about this long term surveillance. For example, it
is not clear what happens to the information post-pandemic because people are
more likely to share their information during a global crisis without
governments having to elaborate on their data policies. Digital Ethnography on
Twitter, which has over 330 million users worldwide, with a majority in the
United States where the pandemic has the worst effects provides a unique
opportunity to learn about real-time opinions of the general public about
current affairs in a rather naturalistic setting. Consequently, it might be
useful to highlight the privacy concerns of users, should they exist, through
analysis of Twitter data and information sharing policies during unprecedented
public health outbreaks. This will allow governments to protect their citizens
both during and after health emergencies.

    <title>In Silico Screening of Some Naturally Occurring Bioactive Compounds
  Predicts Potential Inhibitors against SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) Protease</title>
    <summary>  SARS-COV-2 identified as COVID-19 in Wuhan city of China in the month of
December, 2019 has now been declared as pandemic by World Health Organization
whose transmission chain and cure both have emerged as a tough problem for the
medical fraternity. The reports pertaining to the treatment of this pandemic
are still lacking. We firmly believe that Nature itself provides a simple
solution for any complicated problem created in it which motivated us to carry
out In Silico investigations on some bioactive natural compounds reportedly
found in the fruits and leaves of Anthocephalus Cadamba which is a miraculous
plant found on the earth aiming to predict the potential inhibitors against
aforesaid virus. Having modeled the ground state ligand structure of the such
nine natural compounds applying density functional theory at B3LYP/631+G (d, p)
level we have performed their molecular docking with SARS-COV-2 protease to
calculate the binding affinity as well as to screen the binding at S-protein
site during ligand-protein interactions. Out of these nine studied naturally
occurring compounds; Oleanic Acid has been appeared to be potential inhibitor
for COVID-19 followed by Ursolic Acid,
IsoVallesiachotamine,Vallesiachotamine,Cadambine,Vincosamide-N-Oxide,
Isodihydroamino-cadambine, Pentyle Ester of Chlorogenic Acid and
D-Myo-Inositol. Hence these bioactive natural compounds or their structural
analogs may be explored as anti-COVID19 drug agent which will be possessing the
peculiar feature of cost-less synthesis and less or no side effect due to their
natural occurrence. The solubility and solvent-effect related to the
phytochemicals may be the point of concern. The In-vivo investigations on these
proposed natural compounds or on their structural analogs are invited for
designing and developing the potential medicine/vaccine for the treatment of
COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>SurviveCovid-19 -- A Game for Improving Awareness of Social Distancing
  and Health Measures for Covid-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Pandemics have threatened human race many a times. One of the most important
tasks during a pandemic is to bring awareness among people. Bringing awareness
contributes a lot in controlling any pandemic. Covid-19 has been causing severe
loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and the level of
severity of this disease, it is extremely important to make people aware of
various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining
social distancing, that are to be followed to prevent the disease and break the
chain of spread. This mode of educating individuals about the disease is being
widely carried out as announcements through online or physical awareness
campaigns, advertisements in the media and so on. The younger generations in
the present day spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games.
However, there are very few mobile applications or games, aimed to bring
awareness about a pandemic, which is much lesser in case of Covid-19. Also,
considering the lockdown scenario across the world, games also act as a good
pass time indoors. Hence, we propose a 2D survival based game, SurviveCovid-19,
aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19
outside their homes, by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and
sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android based
mobile game and has been evaluated through a remote qualitative user survey,
with 20 volunteers. The results of the survey are promising with all the
questions of survey having mean value greater than 3.6.

    <title>Hemogram Data as a Tool for Decision-making in COVID-19 Management:
  Applications to Resource Scarcity Scenarios</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 pandemics has challenged emergency response systems worldwide, with
widespread reports of essential services breakdown and collapse of health care
structure. A critical element involves essential workforce management since
current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals,
including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several
countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity.
This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data
performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR
test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for
handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential
workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to
predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or
results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow
fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed
models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with
high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in
an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on
hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is
significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed,
compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and
other critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from
widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR
results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist
strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel
shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.

    <title>Deep learning to estimate the physical proportion of infected region of
  lung for COVID-19 pneumonia with CT image set</title>
    <summary>  Utilizing computed tomography (CT) images to quickly estimate the severity of
cases with COVID-19 is one of the most straightforward and efficacious methods.
Two tasks were studied in this present paper. One was to segment the mask of
intact lung in case of pneumonia. Another was to generate the masks of regions
infected by COVID-19. The masks of these two parts of images then were
converted to corresponding volumes to calculate the physical proportion of
infected region of lung. A total of 129 CT image set were herein collected and
studied. The intrinsic Hounsfiled value of CT images was firstly utilized to
generate the initial dirty version of labeled masks both for intact lung and
infected regions. Then, the samples were carefully adjusted and improved by two
professional radiologists to generate the final training set and test
benchmark. Two deep learning models were evaluated: UNet and 2.5D UNet. For the
segment of infected regions, a deep learning based classifier was followed to
remove unrelated blur-edged regions that were wrongly segmented out such as air
tube and blood vessel tissue etc. For the segmented masks of intact lung and
infected regions, the best method could achieve 0.972 and 0.757 measure in mean
Dice similarity coefficient on our test benchmark. As the overall proportion of
infected region of lung, the final result showed 0.961 (Pearson's correlation
coefficient) and 11.7% (mean absolute percent error). The instant proportion of
infected regions of lung could be used as a visual evidence to assist clinical
physician to determine the severity of the case. Furthermore, a quantified
report of infected regions can help predict the prognosis for COVID-19 cases
which were scanned periodically within the treatment cycle.

    <title>Grandpa, grandpa, tell me the one about Bitcoin being a safe haven:
  Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemics</title>
    <summary>  Bitcoin being a safe haven asset is one of the traditional stories in the
cryptocurrency community. However, during its existence and relevant presence,
i.e. approximately since 2013, there has been no severe situation on the
financial markets globally to prove or disprove this story until the COVID-19
pandemics. We study the quantile correlations of Bitcoin and two benchmarks --
S\&amp;P500 and VIX -- and we make comparison with gold as the traditional safe
haven asset. The Bitcoin safe haven story is shown and discussed to be
unsubstantiated and far-fetched, while gold comes out as a clear winner in this
contest.

  Dataset: Preliminary Thoughts and Lessons Learned</title>
    <summary>  We present the Neural Covidex, a search engine that exploits the latest
neural ranking architectures to provide information access to the COVID-19 Open
Research Dataset curated by the Allen Institute for AI. This web application
exists as part of a suite of tools that we have developed over the past few
weeks to help domain experts tackle the ongoing global pandemic. We hope that
improved information access capabilities to the scientific literature can
inform evidence-based decision making and insight generation. This paper
describes our initial efforts and offers a few thoughts about lessons we have
learned along the way.

    <title>Comparative prediction of confirmed cases with COVID-19 pandemic by
  machine learning, deterministic and stochastic SIR models</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a machine learning technics and SIR models
(deterministic and stochastic cases) with numerical approximations to predict
the number of cases infected with the COVID-19, for both in few days and the
following three weeks. Like in [1] and based on the public data from [2], we
estimate parameters and make predictions to help on how to find concrete
actions to control the situation. Under optimistic estimation, the pandemic in
some countries will end soon, while for most of the countries in the world, the
hit of anti-pandemic will be no later than the beginning of May.

    <title>An Epidemic Model SIPHERD and its application for prediction of the

    <summary>  We propose an epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection
carriers Symptomatic, Purely Asymptomatic, and Exposed are considered with
different rates of transmission of infection that are taken dependent on the
lockdown and social distancing. The rate of detection of the infected carriers
is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is applied for the
COVID outbreak in Germany and South Korea to validate its predictive
capabilities and then applied to India and the United States for the prediction
of its spread with different lockdown situations and testing in the coming
months.

    <title>Understanding the Effects of Tennessee's Open Covid-19 Testing Policy:
  Bounding Policy Effects with Nonrandomly Missing Data</title>
    <summary>  Increased testing for Covid-19 is seen as one of the most important steps to
re-open the economy. The current paper considers Tennessee's "open-testing"
policy where the state substantially increased testing while removing symptom
requirements for individuals to be tested. To understand the effect of the
policy, we combine standard identifying assumptions with additional weak
assumptions to deal with non-random testing that lead to bounds on policy
effects of interest. Our results suggest that Tennessee's open-testing policy
has reduced total cases (which are not fully observed), confirmed cases, and
trips to work among counties with a fast-growing number of confirmed cases.

    <title>An efficient explicit approach for predicting the Covid-19 spreading
  with undetected infectious: The case of Cameroon</title>
    <summary>  This paper considers an explicit numerical scheme for solving the
mathematical model of the propagation of Covid-19 epidemic with undetected
infectious cases. We analyze the stability and convergence rate of the new
approach in $L^{\infty}$-norm. The proposed method is less time consuming.
Furthermore, the method is stable, at least second-order convergent and can
serve as a robust tool for the integration of general systems of ordinary
differential equations. A wide set of numerical evidences which consider the
case of Cameroon are presented and discussed.

    <title>Determination and estimation of optimal quarantine duration for
  infectious diseases with application to data analysis of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Quarantine measure is a commonly used non-pharmaceutical intervention during
the outbreak of infectious diseases. A key problem for implementing quarantine
measure is to determine the duration of quarantine. In this paper, a policy
with optimal quarantine duration is developed. The policy suggests different
quarantine durations for every individual with different characteristic. The
policy is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the average quarantine
duration of uninfected people with the constraint that the probability of
symptom presentation for infected people attains the given value closing to 1.
The optimal solution for the quarantine duration is obtained and estimated by
some statistic methods with application to analyzing COVID-19 data.

    <title>Extracting and categorising the reactions to COVID-19 by the South
  African public -- A social media study</title>
    <summary>  Social Media can be used to extract discussion topics during a disaster. With
the COVID-19 pandemic impact on South Africa, we need to understand how the law
and regulation promulgated by the government in response to the pandemic
contrasts with discussion topics social media users have been engaging in. In
this work, we expand on traditional media analysis by using Social Media
discussions driven by or directed to South African government officials. We
find topics that are similar as well as different in some cases. The findings
can inform further study into social media during disaster settings in South
Africa and beyond.

    <title>GSA-DenseNet121-COVID-19: a Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for the
  Diagnosis of COVID-19 Disease based on Gravitational Search Optimization
  Algorithm</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, a novel approach called GSA-DenseNet121-COVID-19 based on a
hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed using an
optimization algorithm. The CNN architecture that was used is called
DenseNet121 and the optimization algorithm that was used is called the
gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The GSA is adapted to determine the best
values for the hyperparameters of the DenseNet121 architecture, and to achieve
a high level of accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19 disease through chest x-ray
image analysis. The obtained results showed that the proposed approach was able
to correctly classify 98% of the test set. To test the efficacy of the GSA in
setting the optimum values for the hyperparameters of DenseNet121, it was
compared to another optimization algorithm called social ski driver (SSD). The
comparison results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed
GSA-DenseNet121-COVID-19 and its ability to better diagnose COVID-19 disease
than the SSD-DenseNet121 as the second was able to diagnose only 94% of the
test set. As well as, the proposed approach was compared to an approach based
on a CNN architecture called Inception-v3 and the manual search method for
determining the values of the hyperparameters. The results of the comparison
showed that the GSA-DenseNet121 was able to beat the other approach, as the
second was able to classify only 95% of the test set samples.

    <title>"Go eat a bat, Chang!": An Early Look on the Emergence of Sinophobic
  Behavior on Web Communities in the Face of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives in unprecedented
ways. In the face of the projected catastrophic consequences, many countries
have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of
the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable medium
for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same
time, unfortunately, the Web is being exploited for the dissemination of
potentially harmful and disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy
theories and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups, in particular
towards Chinese people since COVID-19 is believed to have originated from
China.
  In this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence of Sinophobic
behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collect
two large-scale datasets from Twitter and 4chan's Politically Incorrect board
(/pol/) over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them to
investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to the
dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that COVID-19 indeed drives the
rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic content
is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like
\dspol, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Also, using
word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution and emergence of new
Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting
differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on
the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift
towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards
using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs.

    <title>Ostwald growth rate in controlled Covid-19 epidemic spreading as in
  arrested growth in quantum complex matter</title>
    <summary>  Here, we focus on the data analysis of the growth of epidemic spread of
Covid-19 in countries where different policies of containment were activated.
It is known that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential,
but it is not known how to quantify the success of different containment
policies. We identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime
following the Ostwald growth, where, over the course of time, one phase
transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed
in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in
crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a
quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment
policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread
but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results
show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking
positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact, we found
values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and
Italy, respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment
policy

    <title>Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM): A Novel Mechanical Ventilator
  Designed for Mass Scale Production in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Presented here is the design of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a
novel mechanical ventilator designed for rapid mass production in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic to address the urgent shortage of intensive therapy
ventilators in many countries, and the growing difficulty in procuring these
devices through normal supply chains across borders. This ventilator is an
electro-mechanical equivalent of the old and reliable Manley Ventilator, and is
able to operate in both pressure-controlled and pressure-supported ventilation
modes. MVM is optimized for the COVID-19 emergency, thanks to the collaboration
with medical doctors in the front line. MVM is designed for large-scale
production in a short amount of time and at a limited cost, as it relays on
off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide. Operation of the MVM
requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and
electrical power. Initial tests of a prototype device with a breathing
simulator are also presented. Further tests and developments are underway. At
this stage the MVM is not yet a certified medical device but certification is
in progress.

    <title>COVID-19 and Computer Audition: An Overview on What Speech &amp; Sound
  Analysis Could Contribute in the SARS-CoV-2 Corona Crisis</title>
    <summary>  At the time of writing, the world population is suffering from more than
10,000 registered COVID-19 disease epidemic induced deaths since the outbreak
of the Corona virus more than three months ago now officially known as
SARS-CoV-2. Since, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer
and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we
provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the
usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this
scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant
phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the
automatic recognition and monitoring of breathing, dry and wet coughing or
sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to
name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These
include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their
development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and
its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient wellbeing. We quickly guide
further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage. We come
to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis
and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so
far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.

    <title>Measuring Human and Economic Activity from Satellite Imagery to Support
  City-Scale Decision-Making during COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 outbreak forced governments worldwide to impose lockdowns and
quarantines over their population to prevent virus transmission. As a
consequence, there are disruptions in human and economic activities all over
the globe. The recovery process is also expected to be rough. Economic
activities impact social behaviors, which leave signatures in satellite images
that can be automatically detected and classified. Satellite imagery can
support the decision-making of analysts and policymakers by providing a
different kind of visibility into the unfolding economic changes. Such
information can be useful both during the crisis and also as we recover from
it.
  In this work, we use a deep learning approach that combines strategic
location sampling and an ensemble of lightweight convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to recognize specific elements in satellite images and compute economic
indicators based on it, automatically. This CNN ensemble framework ranked third
place in the US Department of Defense xView challenge, the most advanced
benchmark for object detection in satellite images. We show the potential of
our framework for temporal analysis using the US IARPA Function Map of the
World (fMoW) dataset. We also show results on real examples of different sites
before and after the COVID-19 outbreak to demonstrate possibilities.
  Among the future work is the possibility that with a satellite image dataset
that samples a region at a weekly (or biweekly) frequency, we can generate more
informative temporal signatures that can predict future economic states. Our
code is being made available at

    <title>Rapidly evaluating lockdown strategies using spectral analysis: the
  cycles behind new daily COVID-19 cases and what happens after lockdown</title>
    <summary>  Spectral analysis characterises oscillatory time series behaviours such as
cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations.
Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and
post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially
interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem
of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian
spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases
for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of
around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are
suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that
the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the
two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases
grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in
cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or
more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series
contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate
interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general
technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates,
which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.

    <title>Early forecasts of the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreaks and
  quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of countering measures</title>
    <summary>  We discovered that the time evolution of the inverse fractional daily growth
of new infections, N/dN, in the current outbreak of COVID-19 is accurately
described by a universal function, namely the two-parameter Gumbel cumulative
function, in all countries that we have investigated. While the two Gumbel
parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country
(and even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the
diversity and efficacy of the adopted containment measures, the functional form
of the evolution of N/dN appears to be universal. The result of the fit in a
given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected
time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters
from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this
allows one to predict with large advance and well-controlled confidence levels,
the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration
(hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections
decrease to a pre-set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per
million people), which can be very useful for planning the reopening of
economic and social activities. We use this formalism to predict and compare
these key features of the evolution of the COVID-19 disease in a number of
countries and provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of success in in
their efforts to countain the outbreak.

    <title>Fighting the COVID-19 Infodemic: Modeling the Perspective of
  Journalists, Fact-Checkers, Social Media Platforms, Policy Makers, and the
  Society</title>
    <summary>  With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the political and the medical
aspects of disinformation merged as the problem got elevated to a whole new
level to become the first global infodemic. Fighting this infodemic is ranked
second in the list of the most important focus areas of the World Health
Organization, with dangers ranging from promoting fake cures, rumors, and
conspiracy theories to spreading xenophobia and panic. Addressing the issue
requires solving a number of challenging problems such as identifying messages
containing claims, determining their check-worthiness and factuality, and their
potential to do harm as well as the nature of that harm, to mention just a few.
Thus, here we design, annotate, and release to the research community a new
dataset for fine-grained disinformation analysis that (i)focuses on COVID-19,
(ii) combines the perspectives and the interests of journalists, fact-checkers,
social media platforms, policy makers, and society as a whole, and (iii) covers
both English and Arabic. Finally, we show strong evaluation results using
state-of-the-art Transformers, thus confirming the practical utility of the
annotation schema and of the dataset.

    <title>The disease-induced herd immunity level for Covid-19 is substantially
  lower than the classical herd immunity level</title>
    <summary>  Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic
despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when
a country or region will reach herd immunity $h$. The classical herd immunity
level $h_C$ is defined as $h_C=1-1/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction
number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending
on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity
level $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set
of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than
$h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured
community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also
categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and
high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates
proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\%$
rather than $h_C=1-1/2.5=60\%$. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is
required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when
immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups
with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates.
Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is
uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.

    <title>Simulating the spread of COVID-19 via spatially-resolved
  susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-deceased (SEIRD) model with
  heterogeneous diffusion</title>
    <summary>  We present an early version of a
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SEIRD) mathematical model
based on partial differential equations coupled with a heterogeneous diffusion
model. The model describes the spatio-temporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,
and aims to capture dynamics also based on human habits and geographical
features. To test the model, we compare the outputs generated by a
finite-element solver with measured data over the Italian region of Lombardy,
which has been heavily impacted by this crisis between February and April 2020.
Our results show a strong qualitative agreement between the simulated forecast
of the spatio-temporal COVID-19 spread in Lombardy and epidemiological data
collected at the municipality level. Additional simulations exploring
alternative scenarios for the relaxation of lockdown restrictions suggest that
reopening strategies should account for local population densities and the
specific dynamics of the contagion. Thus, we argue that data-driven simulations
of our model could ultimately inform health authorities to design effective
pandemic-arresting measures and anticipate the geographical allocation of
crucial medical resources.

    <title>The Impact of Response Measures on COVID-19-Related Hospitalization and
  Death Rates in Germany and Switzerland</title>
    <summary>  We assess the impact of COVID-19 response measures implemented in Germany and
Switzerland on cumulative COVID-19-related hospitalization and death rates. Our
analysis exploits the fact that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions
than in others when certain lockdown measures came into force, based on
measuring health outcomes relative to the region-specific start of the epidemic
and comparing outcomes across regions with earlier and later start dates. When
estimating the effect of the relative timing of measures, we control for
regional characteristics and initial epidemic trends by linear regression
(Germany and Switzerland), doubly robust estimation (Germany), or synthetic
controls (Switzerland). We find for both countries that a relatively later
exposure to the measures entails higher cumulative hospitalization and death
rates on region-specific days after the outbreak of the epidemic, suggesting
that an earlier imposition of measures is more effective than a later one. For
Germany, we also evaluate curfews (as introduced in a subset of states) based
on cross-regional variation. We do not find any effects of curfews on top of
the federally imposed contact restriction that banned groups of more than 2
individuals. Finally, an analysis of mobility patterns in Switzerland shows an
immediate behavioral effect of the lockdown in terms of reduced mobility.

    <title>Simulation of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social network of Slovenia:
  estimating the intrinsic forecast uncertainty</title>
    <summary>  In the article a virus transmission model is constructed on a simplified
social network. The social network consists of more than 2 million nodes, each
representing an inhabitant of Slovenia. The nodes are organised and
interconnected according to the real household and elderly-care center
distribution, while their connections outside these clusters are semi-randomly
distributed and fully-linked. The virus spread model is coupled to the disease
progression model. The ensemble approach with the perturbed transmission and
disease parameters is used to quantify the ensemble spread, a proxy for the
forecast uncertainty. The presented ongoing forecasts of COVID-19 epidemic in
Slovenia are compared with the collected Slovenian data. Results show that
infection is currently twice more likely to transmit within households/elderly
care centers than outside them. We use an ensemble of simulations (N = 1000) to
inversely obtain posterior distributions of model parameters and to estimate
the COVID-19 forecast uncertainty. We found that in the uncontrolled epidemic,
the intrinsic uncertainty mostly originates from the uncertainty of the virus
biology, i.e. its reproductive number. In the controlled epidemic with low
ratio of infected population, the randomness of the social network becomes the
major source of forecast uncertainty, particularly for the short-range
forecasts. Social-network-based models are thus essential for improving
epidemics forecasting.

    <title>Influence of Absolute Humidity and Population Density on COVID-19 Spread
  and Decay Durations: Multi-prefecture Study in Japan</title>
    <summary>  This study analyzed the spread and decay durations of the COVID-19 pandemic
in different prefectures of Japan. In Japan, in addition to affordable wide
coverage health insurance systems, no medical collapse was observed, making
accurate comparisons between prefectures possible. For the 19 prefectures
included in this study that had daily maximum confirmed cases exceeding ten,
the confirmed cases increased and decreased exponentially in the spread and
decay durations in most of the prefectures. A good correlation was observed
between the spread and decay durations (R2=0.37). However, some exceptions were
observed in prefectures that are adjacent to primary prefectures (e.g., Tokyo,
Osaka, Aichi, and Fukuoka) and in areas where people returned from foreign
countries, which were defined origins of cluster infections. Excluding these
prefectures, population density is shown to be the primary factor affecting
spread and decay patterns, with correlations of 0.52 and 0.76, respectively.
The absolute humidity also affected the spread duration (R2=0.40). These
findings could be useful for intervention planning during potential future
pandemics, including a second COVID-19 outbreak.

    <title>Significant reduced traffic in Beijing failed to relieve haze pollution
  during the COVID-19 lockdown: implications for haze mitigation</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 outbreak greatly limited human activities and reduced primary
emissions particularly from urban on-road vehicles, but coincided with Beijing
experiencing pandemic haze, raising the public concerns of the validity and
effectiveness of the imposed traffic policies to improve the air pollution.
Here, we explored the relationship between local vehicle emissions and the
winter haze in Beijing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period based on
an integrated analysis framework, which combines a real-time on-road emission
inventory, in-situ air quality observations and a localized chemical transport
modeling system. We found that traffic emissions decreased substantially
affected by the pandemic, with a higher reduction for NOx (75.9%, 125.3 Mg/day)
compared to VOCs (53.1%, 52.9 Mg/day). Unexpectedly, our results show that the
imbalanced emission abatement of NOx and VOCs from vehicles led to a
significant rise of the atmospheric oxidizing capacity in urban areas, but only
resulting in modest increases in secondary aerosols due to the inadequate
precursors. However, the enhanced oxidizing capacity in the surrounding regions
greatly increased the secondary particles with relatively abundant precursors,
which is mainly responsible for Beijing haze during the lockdown period. Our
results indicate that the winter haze in Beijing was insensitive to the local
vehicular emissions reduction due to the complicated nonlinear response of the
fine particle and air pollutant emissions. We suggest mitigation policies
should focus on accelerating VOC and NH3 emissions reduction and synchronously
controlling regional sources to release the benefits on local traffic emission
control.

    <title>Modeling indoor-level non-pharmaceutical interventions during the
  COVID-19 pandemic: a pedestrian dynamics-based microscopic simulation
  approach</title>
    <summary>  Mathematical modeling of epidemic spreading has been widely adopted to
estimate the threats of epidemic diseases (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) as well
as to evaluate epidemic control interventions. The indoor place is considered
to be a significant epidemic spreading risk origin, but existing widely-used
epidemic spreading models are usually limited for indoor places since the
dynamic physical distance changes between people are ignored, and the empirical
features of the essential and non-essential travel are not differentiated. In
this paper, we introduce a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model that is
capable of modeling indoor transmission risks of diseases during people's
social activities. Taking advantage of the before-and-after mobility data from
the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, it's found that
people tend to spend more time in grocery stores once their travel frequencies
are restricted to a low level. In other words, an increase in dwell time could
balance the decrease in travel frequencies and satisfy people's demand. Based
on the pedestrian-based model and the empirical evidence, combined
non-pharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels are
evaluated. Numerical simulations show that restrictions on people's travel
frequency and open-hours of indoor places may not be universally effective in
reducing average infection risks for each pedestrian who visit the place. Entry
limitations can be a widely effective alternative, whereas the decision-maker
needs to balance the decrease in risky contacts and the increase in queue
length outside the place that may impede people from fulfilling their travel
needs.

    <title>A Time-dependent SIR model for COVID-19 with Undetectable Infected
  Persons</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analyses to address the
following crucial questions for COVID-19: (Q1) Is it possible to contain
COVID-19? (Q2) When will be the peak and the end of the epidemic? (Q3) How do
the asymptomatic infections affect the spread of disease? (Q4) What is the
ratio of the population that needs to be infected to achieve herd immunity?
(Q5) How effective are the social distancing approaches? (Q6) What is the ratio
of the population infected in the long run? For (Q1) and (Q2), we propose a
time-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks 2 time
series: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at
time t. Such an approach is more adaptive than traditional static SIR models
and more robust than direct estimation methods. Using the data provided by
China, we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed
cases are almost in 3%, and the total number of confirmed cases is precisely
predicted. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission
rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted. After that
day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3), we extend
our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable and
undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model is
characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely related
to $R_0$. For (Q4), we show that herd immunity can be achieved after at least
1-1/$R_0$ fraction of individuals being infected. For (Q5) and (Q6), we analyze
the independent cascade (IC) model for disease propagation in a configuration
random graph. By relating the propagation probabilities in the IC model to the
transmission rates and recovering rates in the SIR model, we show 2 approaches
of social distancing that can lead to a reduction of $R_0$.

    <title>Neural Network aided quarantine control model estimation of COVID spread
  in Wuhan, China</title>
    <summary>  In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24
January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a
city of more than 10 million people. This raised the question: is mass
quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its
scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using
a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show
that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down
the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t) &gt; 1 to
R(t) &lt;1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in
Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected
case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health
policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down
the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in
other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail
spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in
the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March
2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction
number at R(t) &lt;1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures
in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent
increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t) &gt;1. Thus, it may be wise
to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which
maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.

    <title>Purim: a rapid method with reduced cost for massive detection of
  CoVid-19</title>
    <summary>  The CoVid-19 is spreading pandemically all over the world. A rapid defeat of
the pandemic requires carrying out on the population a mass screening, able to
separate positive from negative cases. Such a cleaning will free a flow of
productive population. The current rate and cost of testing, performed with the
common PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method and with the available resources,
is forcing a selection of the subjects to be tested. Indeed, each one must be
examined individually at the cost of precious time. Moreover, the exclusion of
potentially positive individuals from screening induces health risks, a broad
slowdown in the effort to curb the viral spread, and the consequent mortality
rates. We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of
Infected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate
sample with inexpensive screening, through the cross-correlated analysis of the
joint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients
and in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the
first or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two-dimensional
correlation case in function of the infection probability. The
multi-dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered.
Extensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their
outcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or
thousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable.
Purim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular
international event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is
growing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion. Therefore, the earlier, the
better.

    <title>Neural Network aided quarantine control model estimation of global
  Covid-19 spread</title>
    <summary>  Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China on Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and met
with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The
effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as
individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect
others without themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to
interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed
first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network
model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on
four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and
compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of
these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number $R_{t}$ of the
virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid
government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and
isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection
and prevent it from exploding exponentially. We test the predictive ability of
our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April 2020 for
Wuhan and in the duration 25 March - 1 April 2020 for Italy and South Korea. In
the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth
and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further
demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead
to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the
role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.

    <title>WeTrace -- A Privacy-preserving Mobile COVID-19 Tracing Approach and
  Application</title>
    <summary>  For the protection of people and society against harm and health threats --
especially for the COVID-19 pandemic -- a variety of different disciplines
needs to be involved. The data collection of very basic and health-related data
of individuals in today's highly mobile society does help to plan, protect, and
identify next steps health authorities and governments can, shall, or need to
plan for or even implement. Thus, every individual, every human, and every
inhabitant of the world is the key player -- very different to many past
crises'. And since the individual is involved -- all individuals -- his/her (a)
health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance,
not overruling one aspect with another one or even prioritizing certain
aspects. Privacy remains the key. Thus, the solution of the current pandemic's
data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which
can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while
maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data
collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic
and can be achieved in a democratic and very open, but still and especially
privacy-protecting world. Therefore, the WeTrace approach and application as
described in this paper utilizes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BTE) communication
channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where asymmetric cryptography is
being applied to allows for the decyphering of a message for that destination
it had been intended for. Since literally every other potential participant
only listens to random data, even a brute force attack will not succeed.
WeTrace and its Open Source implementation is the only known approach so far,
which ensures that any receiver of a message knows that this is for him/her,
but does not know who the original sender was.

    <title>Evaluation of Pool-based Testing Approaches to Enable Population-wide
  Screening for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Background: Rapid testing for an infection is paramount during a pandemic to
prevent continued viral spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study
aimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample
pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2.
  Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six
different testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate,
test characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations
in five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19
outbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and
testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised
prior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of
cases identified; and number of false positives.
  Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input
parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen
one tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when
prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised
testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the
US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight
times faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are
considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex
pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also
reduces the number of false positive diagnoses by 50%.
  Interpretation: The results of this study provide a clear rationale for
adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of
testing for SARS-CoV-2. The current individual testing approach unnecessarily
wastes valuable time and resources.

    <title>Zero-Shot Learning and its Applications from Autonomous Vehicles to
  COVID-19 Diagnosis: A Review</title>
    <summary>  The challenge of learning a new concept, object, or a new medical disease
recognition without receiving any examples beforehand is called Zero-Shot
Learning (ZSL). One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies
such as in Medical Imaging, Autonomous Systems and other real-world
applications is the requirement of feeding a large annotated and labelled
datasets, prepared by an expert human to train the network model. ZSL is known
for having minimal human intervention by mainly relying only on previously
known concepts and current auxiliary information. This is an ever-growing
research for the cases where we have very limited or no datasets available and
at the same time, the detection/recognition system has human-like
characteristics in learning new concepts. Therefore, it makes it applicable in
real-world scenarios, from developing autonomous vehicles to medical imaging
and COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. In this review paper, we
present the definition of the problem, we review over fundamentals, and the
challenging steps of Zero-Shot Learning, including state-of-the-art categories
of solutions as well as our recommended solution, motivations behind each
approach, and their advantages over each category to guide the researchers to
proceed with the best techniques and practices based on their applications.
Inspired from different settings and extensions, we introduce a novel and
broaden solution called one/few-shot learning. We then review through different
image datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety of splits,
and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss the recent
applications and future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful intuition
through this paper towards the goal of handling complex computer vision
learning tasks more similar to the way humans learn.

    <title>Quest: Practical and Oblivious Mitigation Strategies for COVID-19 using
  WiFi Datasets</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing has emerged as one of the main mitigation strategies to
prevent the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19. Recently, several efforts
have been initiated to track individuals, their movements, and interactions
using technologies, e.g., Bluetooth beacons, cellular data records, and
smartphone applications. Such solutions are often intrusive, potentially
violating individual privacy rights and are often subject to regulations (e.g.,
GDPR and CCPR) that mandate the need for opt-in policies to gather and use
personal information. In this paper, we introduce Quest, a system that empowers
organizations to observe individuals and spaces to implement policies for
social distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive
and privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of employees
and occupants at an organization, while protecting the privacy of all parties.
Quest incorporates computationally- and information-theoretically-secure
protocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of an individual's
location history (based on WiFi data); it includes support for accurately
identifying users who were in the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then
informing them via opt-in mechanisms. Quest supports a range of privacy-enabled
applications to ensure adherence to social distancing, monitor the flow of
people through spaces, identify potentially impacted regions, and raise
exposure alerts. We describe the architecture, design choices, and
implementation of the proposed security/privacy techniques in Quest. We, also,
validate the practicality of Quest and evaluate it thoroughly via an actual
campus-scale deployment at UC Irvine over a very large dataset of over 50M
tuples.

    <title>Social Interaction Layers in Complex Networks for the Dynamical Epidemic
  Modeling of COVID-19 in Brazil</title>
    <summary>  We are currently living in a state of uncertainty due to the pandemic caused
by the Sars-CoV-2 virus. There are several factors involved in the epidemic
spreading such as the individual characteristics of each city/country. The true
shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system such as most of the
social systems. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate to
analyze these systems due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamical
properties. Therefore this study presents a new approach to model the COVID-19
epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent people,
edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities.
The model improves the traditional SIR and it is applied to study the Brazilian
epidemic by analyzing possible future actions and their consequences. The
network is characterized using statistics of infection, death, and
hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or
precautionary measures we remove layers and/or reduce the intensity of social
contacts. Results show that even taking various optimistic assumptions, the
current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to a critical scenario for
the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000). If
all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep
increase, and the demand for ICU beds may surpass 3 times the country's
capacity. This would surely lead to a catastrophic scenario, as our estimation
reaches an average of 212,000 deaths even considering that all cases are
effectively treated. The increase of isolation (up to a lockdown) shows to be
the best option to keep the situation under the healthcare system capacity,
aside from ensuring a faster decrease of new case occurrences (months of
difference), and a significantly smaller death toll (average of 87,000).

    <title>Can Testing Ease Social Distancing Measures? Future Evolution of
  COVID-19 in NYC</title>
    <summary>  The "New York State on Pause" executive order came into effect on March 22
with the goal of ensuring adequate social distancing to alleviate the spread of
COVID-19. Pause will remain effective in New York City in some form until early
June. We use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of testing capacity
and social distancing measures on the evolution of the pandemic in the
"post-Pause" period in the City. We find that testing capacity must increase
dramatically if it is to counterbalance even relatively small relaxations in
social distancing measures in the immediate post-Pause period. In particular,
if the City performs 20,000 tests per day and relaxes the social distancing
measures to the pre-Pause norms, then the total number of deaths by the end of
September can reach 250,000. By keeping the social distancing measures to
somewhere halfway between the pre- and in-Pause norms and performing 100,000
tests per day, the total number of deaths by the end of September can be kept
at around 27,000. Going back to the pre-Pause social distancing norms quickly
must be accompanied by an exorbitant testing capacity, if one is to suppress
excessive deaths. If the City is to go back to the "pre-Pause" social
distancing norms in the immediate post-Pause period and keep the total number
of deaths by the end of September at around 35,000, then it should be
performing 500,000 tests per day. Our findings have important implications on
the magnitude of the testing capacity the City needs as it relaxes the social
distancing measures to reopen its economy.

    <title>The impact of COVID-19 on the UK fresh food supply chain</title>
    <summary>  The resilience of the food supply chain is a matter of critical importance,
both for national security and broader societal well bring. COVID19 has
presented a test to the current system, as well as means by which to explore
whether the UK's food supply chain will be resilient to future disruptions. In
the face of a growing need to ensure that food supply is more environmentally
sustainable and socially just, COVOD19 also represents an opportunity to
consider the ability of the system to innovative, and its capacity for change.
The purpose of this case based study is to explore the response and resilience
of the UK fruit and vegetable food supply chain to COVID19, and to assess this
empirical evidence in the context of a resilience framework based on the
adaptive cycle. To achieve this we reviewed secondary data associated with
changes to retail demand, conducted interviews with 23 organisations associated
with supply to this market, and conducted four video workshops with 80
organisations representing half of the UK fresh produce community. The results
highlight that, despite significant disruption, the retail dominated fresh food
supply chain has demonstrated a high degree of resilience. In the context of
the adaptive cycle, the system has shown signs of being stuck in a rigidity
trap, as yet unable to exploit more radical innovations that may also assist in
addressing other drivers for change. This has highlighted the significant role
that innovation and R&amp;D communities will need to play in enabling the supply
chain to imagine and implement alternative future states post COVID.

    <title>A scaling approach to estimate the COVID-19 infection fatality ratio
  from incomplete data</title>
    <summary>  SARS-CoV-2 has disrupted the life of billions of people around the world
since the first outbreak was officially declared in China at the beginning of
2020. Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread
within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the
`universal' growth of the mortality rate with age observed in different
countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the
results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil
both unknowns. We validate these results with an analogous antibody rate survey
in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. We also argue that the official number of
deaths over 70 years old is importantly underestimated in most of the
countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the
number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by
how much. Using this information, we estimate the fatality infection ratio
(IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population
infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all
age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the
sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar growth of the
fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if
infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the
intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly
exponential growth of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large
differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions,
with numbers that range from 1.82\% in Italy, to 0.62\% in China or even 0.14\%
in middle Africa.

    <title>The relationship between human mobility and viral transmissibility
  during the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy</title>
    <summary>  We describe in this report our studies to understand the relationship between
human mobility and the spreading of COVID-19, as an aid to manage the restart
of the social and economic activities after the lockdown and monitor the
epidemics in the coming weeks and months. We compare the evolution (from
January to May 2020) of the daily mobility flows in Italy, measured by means of
nation-wide mobile phone data, and the evolution of transmissibility, measured
by the net reproduction number, i.e., the mean number of secondary infections
generated by one primary infector in the presence of control interventions and
human behavioural adaptations. We find a striking relationship between the
negative variation of mobility flows and the net reproduction number, in all
Italian regions, between March 11th and March 18th, when the country entered
the lockdown. This observation allows us to quantify the time needed to "switch
off" the country mobility (one week) and the time required to bring the net
reproduction number below 1 (one week). A reasonably simple regression model
provides evidence that the net reproduction number is correlated with a
region's incoming, outgoing and internal mobility. We also find a strong
relationship between the number of days above the epidemic threshold before the
mobility flows reduce significantly as an effect of lockdowns, and the total
number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100k inhabitants, thus indirectly
showing the effectiveness of the lockdown and the other non-pharmaceutical
interventions in the containment of the contagion. Our study demonstrates the
value of "big" mobility data to the monitoring of key epidemic indicators to
inform choices as the epidemics unfolds in the coming months.

    <title>Estimation of Basic Reproduction Number of the COVID-19 Epidemic in
  Denmark using a Two-Step Model</title>
    <summary>  Objective: To conduct an early estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number
(BRN) induced by government interference, and to project resulting day to day
number of in-patients, ICU-patients and cumulative number of deaths in a Danish
setting.
  Method: We used the Kermack and McKendrick model with varying basic
reproduction number to estimate number infected and age stratified percentages
to estimate number of in-patients, ICU-patients and cumulative number of
deaths. Changes in basic reproduction number was estimated based on current
in-patient numbers.
  Results: The basic reproductive number in the time period of February 27th to
March 18th was found to be 2.65, however, this number was reduced to 1.99 after
March 18th.
  Keywords: COVID-19, basic reproduction number, Danish population

    <title>Robust predictive model for Carriers, Infections and Recoveries (CIR):
  predicting death rates for CoVid-19 in Spain</title>
    <summary>  This article presents a new model to predict the evolution of infective
diseases under uncertainty or low-quality information, just as it has happened
in the initial scenario during the CoVid-19 spread in China and Europe. The
model has been used to predict the death rate in Spain but can be used to
predict the demand of ICUs or mechanical ventilators under different restraint
policies. The main novelty of the model is that it keeps track of the date of
infection of a single individual and uses stochastic distributions to aggregate
individuals who share the same date of infection. In addition, it uses two
types of infections, mild and serious, with a different recovery time. These
features are implemented in a set of differential equations which determine the
number of Carriers, Infections, Recoveries, Hospitalized and Deaths. Comparison
with real data shows good agreement.

    <title>Enabling and Enforcing Social Distancing Measures using Smart City and
  ITS Infrastructures: A COVID-19 Use Case</title>
    <summary>  Internet of Things is a revolutionary domain that has the caliber to impact
our lives and bring significant changes to the world. Several IoT applications
have been envisioned to facilitate data driven and smart application for the
user. Smart City and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) offer a futuristic
vision of smart, secure and safe experience to the end user, and at the same
time efficiently manage the sparse resources and optimize the efficiency of
city operations. However, outbreaks and pandemics like COVID-19 have revealed
limitations of the existing deployments, therefore, architecture, applications
and technology systems need to be developed for swift and timely enforcement of
guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks. This
work outlines novel architecture, potential use-cases and some future
directions in developing such applications using Smart City and ITS.

    <title>Epidemic SEIQRDP model using genetic fitting algorithm with
  cross-validation and application to early dynamics of COVID-19 in Algeria</title>
    <summary>  A SEIQRDP epidemic model based on genetic fitting algorithm is proposed to
estimate COVID-19 outbreak dynamics in Algeria between February 25th and May
24th. Using a cross-validation method to overcome the overfitting problem, we
advance approximate nowcast and forecast of the epidemic evolution including
key epidemic parameters and non-measurable asymptomatic infected portion of the
susceptible population. Basic reproduction number on Feb. 25th is estimated to
3.78 (95% CI 3.033-4.53) and effective reproduction number on May 24th after
three months of the outbreak is estimated to 0.651 (95% CI 0.539- 0.761).
Infection peak time is predicted to the end of April while active cases peak
time is predicted to the end of May 2020. The disease incidence, CFR and IFR
are calculated. Information provided by this study could help establish a
realistic assessment of the situation for the time being, inform predictions
about potential future evolution, and guide the design of appropriate public
health measures.

    <title>Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases
  of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China</title>
    <summary>  The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a
distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases during the
early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected
for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate.
Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland
China, the scaling law $t^{\mu}$ is surprisingly universal, with a range of
exponents $\mu=2.1\pm0.3$. The universality of this behavior indicates that
despite social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical
heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by
fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological
models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of
containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To
this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of
symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in
response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of
parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases
and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit
the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or
oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of
local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the
observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective
contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a
substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the
implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19
secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent
infectious diseases.

    <title>Spatiotemporal Patterns of COVID-19 Impact on Human Activities and
  Environment in China Using Nighttime Light and Air Quality Data</title>
    <summary>  In order to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on people's lives, activities and
the natural environment, this paper investigates the spatial and temporal
characteristics of Night Time Light (NTL) radiance and Air Quality Index (AQI)
before and during the pandemic in mainland China. Our results show that the
monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than
before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area,
transportation and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance
ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 nW/(cm*cm*sr), respectively. We found
that the Number Of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential
area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after
the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the
same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first
confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were
taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers
were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior,
while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness, after
the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant
decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for the whole country, with cleaner
air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In
conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on
people's daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation
of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of
China has improved with the reduction of non-essential industries and motor
vehicle usage.

    <title>Making Sense of the Current Covid 19 Situation and Suggesting a tailored
  Release Strategy through Modeling And Simulation Case Study: Casablanca,
  Morocco</title>
    <summary>  Since the very first days of announcing Covid 19 as a global pandemic,
researchers around the world from different backgrounds and organizations
including national governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) have
extensively begun using Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) techniques in deciding on
the optimal strategies in order to mitigate the public health and economical
effects of Covid-19. In this paper, we present our results from applying M&amp;S on
the city of Casablanca, Morocco to comprehend (i): How it can be relatively
easy or difficult for such pandemic to penetrate to the studied region
(country, city, district, etc.). (ii): How it can spread relatively fast or
slow within that region. And finally (iii): What is the optimal strategy for
containing and mitigating the propagation of the disease while still keeping
the economy as near to normal as possible.

    <title>The short-term seasonal analyses between atmospheric environment and
  COVID-19 in epidemic areas of Cities in Australia, South Korea, and Italy</title>
    <summary>  The impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on health has been widely concerned.
Disease risk assessment, prediction, and early warning have become a
significant research field. Previous research suggests that there is a
relationship between air quality and the disease. This paper investigated the
impact of the atmospheric environment on the basic reproduction number (R$_0$)
in Australia, South Korea, and Italy by using atmospheric environment data,
confirmed case data, and the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) model
based on Quasi-Poisson regression. The results show that the air temperature
and humidity have lag and persistence on short-term R$_0$, and seasonal factors
have an apparent decorating effect on R$_0$. PM$_{10}$ is the primary pollutant
that affects the excess morbidity rate. Moreover, O$_3$, PM$_{2.5}$, and SO$_2$
as perturbation factors have an apparent cumulative effect. These results
present beneficial knowledge for correlation between environment and COVID-19,
which guiding prospective analyses of disease data.

    <title>Impact of the State of Emergency Declaration for COVID-19 on Preventive
  Behaviors and Mental Conditions in Japan: Difference in Difference Analysis
  using Panel Data</title>
    <summary>  During the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan between March and April 2020, Internet
surveys were conducted to construct panel data to investigate changes at the
individual level regarding preventive behaviors and mental conditions by
surveying the same respondents at different times. Specifically, the
difference-in-difference (DID) method was used to explore the impact of the
COVID-19 state of emergency declared by the government. Key findings were: (1)
the declaration led people to stay home, while also generating anger, fear, and
anxiety. (2) The effect of the declaration on the promotion of preventive
behaviors was larger than the detrimental effect on mental conditions. (3)
Overall, the effect on women was larger than that on men.

    <title>How many infections of COVID-19 there will be in the "Diamond
  Princess"-Predicted by a virus transmission model based on the simulation of
  crowd flow</title>
    <summary>  Objectives: Simulate the transmission process of COVID-19 in a cruise ship,
and then to judge how many infections there will be in the 3711 people in the
"Diamond Princess" and analyze measures that could have prevented mass
transmission.
  Methods: Based on the crowd flow model, the virus transmission rule between
pedestrians is established, to simulate the spread of the virus caused by the
close contact during pedestrians' daily activities on the cruise ship.
  Measurements and main results: Three types of simulation scenarios are
designed, the Basic scenario focus on the process of virus transmission caused
by a virus carrier and the effect of the personal protective measure against
the virus. The condition that the original virus carriers had disembarked
halfway and more and more people strengthen self-protection are considered in
the Self-protection scenario, which would comparatively accord with the actual
situation of "Diamond princess" cruise. Control scenario are set to simulate
the effect of taking recommended or mandatory measures on virus transmission
  Conclusions: There are 850~1009 persons (with large probability) who have
been infected with COVID-19 during the voyage of "Diamond Princess". The crowd
infection percentage would be controlled effectively if the recommended or
mandatory measures can be taken immediately during the alert phase of COVID-19
outbreaks.

    <title>Strong correlations between power-law growth of COVID-19 in four
  continents and the inefficiency of soft quarantine strategies</title>
    <summary>  In this work we analyse the growth of the cumulative number of confirmed
infected cases by the COVID-19 until March 27th, 2020, from countries of Asia,
Europe, North and South America. Our results show (i) that power-law growth is
observed for all countries; (ii) by using the distance correlation, that the
power-law curves between countries are statistically highly correlated,
suggesting the universality of such curves around the World; and (iii) that
soft quarantine strategies are inefficient to flatten the growth curves.
Furthermore, we present a model and strategies which allow the government to
reach the flattening of the power-law curves. We found that, besides the social
distance of individuals, of well known relevance, the strategy of identifying
and isolating infected individuals in a large daily rate can help to flatten
the power-laws. These are essentially the strategies used in the Republic of
Korea. The high correlation between the power-law curves of different countries
strongly indicate that the government containment measures can be applied with
success around the whole World. These measures must be scathing and applied as
soon as possible.

    <title>Bayesian semiparametric time varying model for count data to study the
  spread of the COVID-19 cases</title>
    <summary>  Recent outbreak of the novel corona virus COVID-19 has affected all of our
lives in one way or the other. While medical researchers are working hard to
find a cure and doctors/nurses to attend the affected individuals, measures
such as `lockdown', `stay-at-home', `social distancing' are being implemented
in different parts of the world to curb its further spread. To model this
spread which is assumed to be a non-stationary count-valued time series, we
propose a novel time varying semiparametric AR$(p)$ model for the count valued
data of newly affected cases, collected every day and also extend it to propose
a novel time varying semiparametric INGARCH model. We calculate posterior
contraction rates of the proposed Bayesian methods. Our proposed structures of
the models are amenable to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for efficient
computation. We show excellent performance in simulations. Our method is then
applied on the daily time series data of newly confirmed cases to study its
spread through different government interventions.

    <title>A decision support system for optimizing the cost of social distancing
  in order to stop the spread of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Currently there are many attempts around the world to use computers,
smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices in order to stop the spread
of COVID-19. Most of these attempts focus on collecting information about
infected people, in order to help healthy people avoid contact with them.
However, social distancing decisions are still taken by the governments
empirically. That is, the authorities do not have an automated tool to
recommend which decisions to make in order to maximize social distancing and to
minimize the impact for the economy. In this paper we address the
aforementioned problem and we design an algorithm that provides social
distancing methods (i.e., what schools, shops, factories, etc. to close) that
are efficient (i.e., that help reduce the spread of the virus) and have low
impact on the economy. On short: a) we propose several models (i.e.,
combinatorial optimization problems); b) we show some theoretical results
regarding the computational complexity of the formulated problems; c) we give
an algorithm for the most complex of the previously formulated problems; d) we
implement and test our algorithm; and e) we show an integer linear program
formulation for our problem.

    <title>Modeling ambient temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of
  respiratory droplets and their role in Covid-19 outbreaks</title>
    <summary>  One of the many unresolved questions that revolves around the Covid-19
pandemic is whether local outbreaks can depend on ambient conditions like
temperature and relative humidity. In this paper, we develop a model that tries
to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of
respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral
outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the
infected population based on a reaction mechanism - the final equations of
which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the
pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound
physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision
rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In
the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for
disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation
time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally
crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the
experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of
pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model.
Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature
and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions. Since
the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant, ambient
temperature and relative humidity are shown to impact the outbreak growth
rates.

    <title>In silico identification of clinically approved medicines against the
  main protease of SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of covid-19</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health disaster.
Main protease is an attractive drug target among coronaviruses, due to its
vital role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral
RNA. There is presently no exact drug or treatment for this diseases caused by
SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we report the potential inhibitory activity
of some FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main protease by molecular
docking study to investigate their binding affinity in protease active site.
Docking studies revealed that drug Oseltamivir (anti-H1N1 drug), Rifampin
(anti-TB drug), Maraviroc, Etravirine, Indinavir, Rilpivirine (anti-HIV drugs)
and Atovaquone, Quinidine, Halofantrine, Amodiaquine, Tetracylcine,
Azithromycin, hydroxycholoroquine (anti-malarial drugs) among others binds in
the active site of the protease with similar or higher affinity. However, the
in-silico abilities of the drug molecules tested in this study, further needs
to be validated by carrying out in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, this
study spreads the potential use of current drugs to be considered and used to
comprise the fast expanding SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    <title>How to Return to Normalcy: Fast and Comprehensive Contact Tracing of
  COVID-19 through Proximity Sensing Using Mobile Devices</title>
    <summary>  We outline a contact-tracing strategy based on proximity sensing using mobile
devices. We discuss what an ideal system should look like and what it can do.
We show that, when adopted sufficiently broadly, such a contact-tracing
strategy can bring COVID-19 under complete control, end the need of social
distancing, and return the society to full normalcy. We also review some of the
challenges faced by the current generation of proximity-sensing technologies,
including Bluetooth Low Energy used by phones, and consider both interim and
longer-term solutions. Our main contribution is that we reason through why such
a contact-tracing strategy is likely to achieve the stated goal of returning to
full normalcy. Using probabilistic models, we show that universal adoption is
not necessary to achieve the stated goal, thus there is some room for
exceptions; however, the adoption rate needs to be very high, e.g., above
$95\%$ depending on the disease parameters. With more vigilance in disease
surveillance to detect mild cases earlier, the number may be brought down to
about $90\%$. The results call for deployment effort to be led by public
authorities at the state or federal level so that the required adoption rate
can be reached and the tracing coverage is wide enough to be relevant for
disease control.

    <title>Longitudinal laboratory testing tied to PCR diagnostics in COVID-19
  patients reveals temporal evolution of distinctive coagulopathy signatures</title>
    <summary>  Temporal inference from laboratory testing results and their triangulation
with clinical outcomes as described in the associated unstructured text from
the providers notes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is integral to
advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg
patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a
two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing
dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation
and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma
fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of
patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these
measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with
declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower
and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented
curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events
after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet
reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal
trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19
associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes
longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural
network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study
demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each
patients specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing
better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen.

    <title>Predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic with the A-SIR model:
  Lombardy, Italy and São Paulo state, Brazil</title>
    <summary>  The presence of a large number of infected individuals with few or no
symptoms is an important epidemiological difficulty and the main mathematical
feature of COVID-19. The A-SIR model, i.e. a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed)
model with a compartment for infected individuals with no symptoms or few
symptoms was proposed by Giuseppe Gaeta, arXiv:2003.08720 [q-bio.PE] (2020). In
this paper we investigate a slightly generalized version of the same model and
propose a scheme for fitting the parameters of the model to real data using the
time series only of the deceased individuals. The scheme is applied to the
concrete cases of Lombardy, Italy and S\~ao Paulo state, Brazil, showing
different aspects of the epidemics. For each case we show that we may have good
fits to the data up to the present, but with very large differences in the
future behavior. The reasons behind such disparate outcomes are the uncertainty
on the value of a key parameter, the probability that an infected individual is
fully symptomatic, and on the intensity of the social distancing measures
adopted. This conclusion enforces the necessity of trying to determine the real
number of infected individuals in a population, symptomatic or asymptomatic.

    <title>On a coupled time-dependent SIR models fitting with New York and
  New-Jersey states COVID-19 data</title>
    <summary>  This article describes a simple Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model
fitting with COVID-19 data for the month of march 2020 in New York (NY) state.
The model is a classical SIR, but is non-autonomous; the rate of susceptible
people becoming infected is adjusted over time in order to fit the available
data. The death rate is also secondarily adjusted. Our fitting is made under
the assumption that due to limiting number of tests, a large part of the
infected population has not been tested positive. In the last part, we extend
the model to take into account the daily fluxes between New Jersey (NJ) and NY
states and fit the data for both states. Our simple model fits the available
data, and illustrates typical dynamics of the disease: exponential increase,
apex and decrease. The model highlights a decrease in the transmission rate
over the period which gives a quantitative illustration about how lockdown
policies reduce the spread of the pandemic. The coupled model with NY and NJ
states shows a wave in NJ following the NY wave, illustrating the mechanism of
spread from one attractive hot spot to its neighbor. }

    <title>To mask or not to mask: Modeling the potential for face mask use by the
  general public to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential
of this intervention is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model
for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general,
asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious.
Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of
New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively
ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of
COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use
decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the
product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts
blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the
impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear,
indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Masks
are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy
persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption
scenarios suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately
(50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths
over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by
34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Our results suggest use of
face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing
community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide
benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with
other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when
adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.

    <title>Recognition of potential Covid-19 drug treatments through the study of
  existing protein-drug and protein-protein structures: an analysis of
  kinetically active residues</title>
    <summary>  We report results of our study of approved drugs as potential treatments for
COVID 19, based on the application of various bioinformatics predictive
methods. The drugs studied include Chloroquine, Ivermectin, Remdesivir and
alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DMFO). Our results indicate that these small
drug molecules selectively bind to stable, kinetically active residues and
residues adjoining them on the surface of proteins and inside protein pockets,
and that some prefer hydrophobic over other active sites. Our approach is not
restricted to viruses and can facilitate rational drug design, as well as
improve our understanding of molecular interactions, in general.

    <title>RelDenClu:A Relative Density based Biclustering Method for identifying
  non-linear feature relations with an Application to identify factors
  effecting spread of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The existing biclustering algorithms for finding feature relation based
biclusters often depend on assumptions like monotonicity or linearity. Though a
few algorithms overcome this problem by using density-based methods, they tend
to miss out many biclusters because they use global criteria for identifying
dense regions. The proposed method, RelDenClu uses the local variations in
marginal and joint densities for each pair of features to find the subset of
observations, which forms the bases of the relation between them. It then finds
the set of features connected by a common set of observations, resulting in a
bicluster.
  To show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, experimentation has
been carried out on fifteen types of simulated data. It has been used for
unsupervised learning using three real-life datasets. Applicability of the
algorithm is also explored on three real-life datasets to see its utility as an
aid to supervised learning. For all the cases the performance of the proposed
method is compared with that of seven different state-of-the-art algorithms.
The proposed algorithm produces better results. The efficacy of the algorithm
is shown on COVID-19 dataset and found out that some features (genetic,
demographics and others) are likely to affect the spread of COVID-19.

    <title>Suppression of Groups Intermingling as Appealing Option For Flattening
  and Delaying the Epidemiological Curve While Allowing Economic and Social
  Life at Bearable Level During COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we simulate the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in a population
modeled as a network of groups wherein infection can propagate both via
intra-group and via inter-group interactions. Our results emphasize the
importance of diminishing the inter-group infections in the effort of
substantial flattening and delaying of the epi(demiologic) curve with
concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social consequences. To
exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10)
noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a
stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections
reduced and postponed in time by the same factor $m$ (5 or 10). More generally,
our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus
spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling
between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure
reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g.,
large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools,
(seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the
proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more
bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone. Last but not least, the
declaration, for the first time in Europe, that COVID-19 epidemic ended in the
two million people Slovenia may be taken as confirming the advantage of the
strategy proposed in this paper.

    <title>Covid-19 -- A simple statistical model for predicting ICU load in
  exponential phases of the disease</title>
    <summary>  One major bottleneck in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is the limited number
of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic development of infections and the
time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them
enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can
easily be underestimated. To derive future ICU load from reported infections,
we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2)
allows for making predictions depending on different future growth rates. We
evaluate our model for public data from Berlin, Germany, by first estimating
the model parameters (i.e., time lag and average stay in ICU) for March 2020
and then using an exponential model to predict the future ICU load for April
and May 2020. Assuming an ICU rate of 5%, a time lag of 5 days and an average
stay of 14 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data and is in accord with
independent estimates. Our model is then used to predict future ICU load
assuming a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%). For
example, based on our parameters the model predicts that the number of ICU
patients at the end of May would be 246 if the exponential growth were to
continue at a rate of 3%, 1,056 if the growth rate were 5% and 3,758 if the
growth rate were 7%. The model can be adjusted as estimates of parameters
develop and can thus also help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU
capacity. Although our predictions are based on a small data set, disregard
non-stationary dynamics, and have a number of assumptions, especially an
exponential development of cases, our model is simple, robust, adaptable and
can be up-dated when further data become available.

    <title>Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent
  Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations</title>
    <summary>  We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of
universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one
employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing
individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1)
significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a
population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the
population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking
is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when
universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower
filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we
compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected
that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies,
their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily
case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early
universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or
reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical
simulations.
  Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of
universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is
emerging as a key NPI; a "mouth-and-nose lockdown" is far more sustainable than
a "full body lockdown", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An
interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all.
We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for
correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure
self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's
community.

    <title>Conspiracy in the Time of Corona: Automatic detection of Covid-19
  Conspiracy Theories in Social Media and the News</title>
    <summary>  Rumors and conspiracy theories thrive in environments of low confidence and
low trust. Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the Covid-19
pandemic are proliferating given the lack of any authoritative scientific
consensus on the virus, its spread and containment, or on the long term social
and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently
circulating are ones suggesting that the 5G network activates the virus, that
the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a
bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it
as cover to launch a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to
dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent
events including the destruction of property, racially fueled attacks against
Asian Americans, and demonstrations espousing resistance to public health
orders countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl
social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated
machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks
supporting the generation of these stories. We show how the various narrative
frameworks fueling rumors and conspiracy theories rely on the alignment of
otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the
broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can
be monitored in near real-time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news
that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists.
Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative
frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be
helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.

    <title>Intermittent yet coordinated regional strategies can alleviate the
  COVID-19 epidemic: a network model of the Italian case</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 epidemic that emerged in Wuhan China at the end of 2019 hit
Italy particularly hard, yielding the implementation of strict national
lockdown rules (Phase 1). There is now a hot ongoing debate in Italy and abroad
on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit a national lockdown
(Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting
scenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other
nations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can
independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service.
In this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is
essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to
design effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve
this, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each
region on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using
the model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national
lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government to mitigate the
spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level. We also
propose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions can be
effective in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the
epidemic, while avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and
mitigating impact on costs. Our study and methodology can be easily extended to
other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the same region or states
in other federal countries, etc.) to support policy- and decision-makers.

    <title>DHP Framework: Digital Health Passports Using Blockchain -- Use case on
  international tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  In order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries enforced
extended social distancing measures for several weeks, effectively pausing the
majority of economic activities. In an effort to resume economic activity
safely, several Digital Contact Tracing applications and protocols have been
introduced with success. However, DCT is a reactive method, as it aims to break
existing chains of disease transmission in a population. Therefore DCT is not
suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that
relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals
travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations
characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to
use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among
different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is
limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a
Health Passport as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free
and how it could be used to resume the international tourism sector. Following,
we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of
Authority for issuing Digital Health Passports. The framework provides a
distributed infrastructure supporting the issuance of DHPs by foreign health
systems and their verification by relevant stakeholders, such as airline
companies and border control authorities. We discuss the attributes of the
system in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy.
Finally, we conclude by identifying future extensions of our work on formal
security and privacy properties that need to be rigorously guaranteed via
appropriate security protocols.

    <title>Decentralized is not risk-free: Understanding public perceptions of
  privacy-utility trade-offs in COVID-19 contact-tracing apps</title>
    <summary>  Contact-tracing apps have potential benefits in helping health authorities to
act swiftly to halt the spread of COVID-19. However, their effectiveness is
heavily dependent on their installation rate, which may be influenced by
people's perceptions of the utility of these apps and any potential privacy
risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user
identity and location). In this paper, we present a survey study that examined
people's willingness to install six different contact-tracing apps after
informing them of the risks and benefits of each design option (with a
U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, $N=208$). The six app designs
covered two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic
contact tracing vs. also providing hotspot information), grounded in our
analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals.
  Contrary to assumptions of some prior work, we found that the majority of
people in our sample preferred to install apps that use a centralized server
for contact tracing, as they are more willing to allow a centralized authority
to access the identity of app users rather than allowing tech-savvy users to
infer the identity of diagnosed users. We also found that the majority of our
sample preferred to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations
in public places to show hotspots of infection. Our results suggest that apps
using a centralized architecture with strong security protection to do basic
contact tracing and providing users with other useful information such as
hotspots of infection in public places may achieve a high adoption rate in the
U.S.

    <title>HLA predictions from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of five
  patients at the early stage of the Wuhan seafood market COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <summary>  We are in the midst of a global viral pandemic, one with no cure and a high
mortality rate. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene complex plays a critical
role in host immunity. We predicted HLA class I and II alleles from the
transcriptome sequencing data prepared from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
samples of five patients at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. We
identified the HLA-I allele A*24:02 in four out of five patients, which is
higher than the expected frequency (17.2%) in the South Han Chinese population.
The difference is statistically significant with a p-value less than $10^{-4}$.
Our analysis results may help provide future insights on disease
susceptibility.

    <title>Impacts of State-Level Policies on Social Distancing in the United
  States Using Aggregated Mobility Data during the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Social distancing has emerged as the primary mitigation strategy to combat
the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. However, large-scale evaluation of
the public's response to social distancing campaigns has been lacking. We used
anonymized and aggregated mobility data from Google Location History users to
estimate the impact of social distancing recommendations on bulk mobility among
users who have opted into this service. We found that state-of-emergency
declarations resulted in approximately a 10% reduction in time spent away from
places of residence. Implementation of one or more social distancing policies
resulted in an additional 25% reduction in mobility the following week.
Subsequent shelter-in-place mandates provided an additional 29% reduction. Our
findings provide evidence that state-wide mandates are effective in promoting
social distancing within this study group.

    <title>Understanding and monitoring the local progression of the Covid-19
  epidemic from medical emergency calls: the example of the Paris area</title>
    <summary>  We portray the evolution of the Covid-19 epidemic during the crisis of
March-April 2020 in the Paris area, by analyzing the medical emergency calls
received by the EMS of the four central departments of this area (Centre 15 of
SAMU 75, 92, 93 and 94). Our study reveals strong dissimilarities between these
departments. We show that the logarithm of each epidemic observable can be
approximated by a piecewise linear function of time. This allows us to
distinguish the different phases of the epidemic, and to identify the delay
between sanitary measures and their influence on the load of EMS. This also
leads to an algorithm, allowing one to detect epidemic resurgences. We rely on
a transport PDE epidemiological model, and we use methods from Perron-Frobenius
theory and tropical geometry.

    <title>The effect of adaptive mobility policy to the spread of COVID-19 in
  urban environment: intervention analysis of Seoul, South Korea</title>
    <summary>  Although severe mobility restrictions are recognized as the key enabler to
contain COVID-19, there has been few scientific studies to validate such
approach, especially in urban context. This study analyzes mobility pattern
changes in Seoul, South Korea that adopted adaptive approach toward mobility.
Intervention analyses reveal that major mobility reduction did occur two weeks
before the city's case peak. Such voluntary adjustments exhibit strong
preference shift toward private mode from public transit. Large reductions
occurred in non-essential and high-contact activities of shopping and dining,
while work and Starbucks trips were less affected. The collective evaluation
reveal that major changes in epidemiology, mobility and policy occurred
simultaneously, with no lagging nor leading contributors. Our study
demonstrates that collective understanding the mutual aspects among mobility,
epidemiology and policy is essential. Incremental and flexible mobility
restriction is not only possible but necessary, especially for a pandemic of
extensive spatial and temporal scales.

    <title>Temporal rise in the proportion of younger adults and older adolescents
  among COVID-19 cases in Germany: evidence of lesser adherence to social
  distancing practices?</title>
    <summary>  Background: There is uncertainty about the role of different age groups in
propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries. Methods: We used
the Koch Institute data on COVID-19 cases in Germany. To minimize the effect of
changes in healthcare seeking behavior and testing practices, we included the
following 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each
age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g
among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period),
as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period),
and the relative risk RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a
higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2) is interpreted as the relative
increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 for g1 compared to g2 for
the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk was highest for
individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals
aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged
25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y
(RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y
(RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in
the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y)
among COVID-19 cases is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood
of seeking medical care/being tested for individuals in those age groups
compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, suggesting an actual increase in
the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the
German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among
individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age
groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.

    <title>Observed and estimated prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy: Is it possible
  to estimate the total cases from medical swabs data?</title>
    <summary>  During the current Covid-19 pandemic in Italy, official data are collected
with medical swabs following a pure convenience criterion which, at least in an
early phase, has privileged the exam of patients showing evident symptoms.
However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients
(e. g. Aguilar et al., 2020; Chugthai et al, 2020; Li, et al., 2020; Mizumoto
et al., 2020a, 2020b and Yelin et al., 2020). In this situation, in order to
estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it
should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it
would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw
sound probabilistic inference. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total
prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time
series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic
in earlier time (Brogi et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose to estimate the
prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data
published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\`a so as to obtain a more
representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure
commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a
distribution which is more similar to the population (Valliant et al., 2018).
In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order
to derive the weights necessary for reweighting them using age and gender as
post-stratification variables thus obtaining more reliable estimation of
prevalence and lethality.

    <title>Are official confirmed cases and fatalities counts good enough to study
  the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics? A critical assessment through the case of
  Italy</title>
    <summary>  As the COVID-19 outbreak is developing the two most frequently reported
statistics seem to be the raw confirmed case and case fatalities counts.
Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two
values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread.
In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would
be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction
of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region)
generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region)
15th-22nd March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing
trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not
representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort.
This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests
and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model
parameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed
case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also
fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone
to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the
national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are
taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official
data of total death counts up to 15th April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to
10th May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work we do not fit models but we
rather investigate whether this task is possible at all. This work also informs
about a new tool to collect and harmonize official statistics coming from
different sources in the form of a package for the R statistical environment
and presents the COVID-19 Data Hub.

    <title>Public Willingness to Get Vaccinated Against COVID-19: How AI-Developed
  Vaccines Can Affect Acceptance</title>
    <summary>  Vaccines for COVID-19 are currently under clinical trials. These vaccines are
crucial for eradicating the novel coronavirus. Despite the potential, there
exist conspiracies related to vaccines online, which can lead to vaccination
hesitancy and, thus, a longer-standing pandemic. We used a between-subjects
study design (N=572 adults in the UK and UK) to understand the public
willingness towards vaccination against the novel coronavirus under various
circumstances. Our survey findings suggest that people are more reluctant to
vaccinate their children compared to themselves. Explicitly stating the high
effectiveness of the vaccine against COVID-19 led to an increase in vaccine
acceptance. Interestingly, our results do not indicate any meaningful variance
due to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in developing vaccines, if these
systems are described to be in use alongside human researchers. We discuss the
public's expectation of local governments in assuring the safety and
effectiveness of a future COVID-19 vaccine.

    <title>Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-pharmaceutical
  interventions on COVID-19 in European countries: technical description update</title>
    <summary>  Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread
outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics. In response, many
European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical
interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and
universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most
recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns.
  In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical
model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of
infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive
number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these
interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in
behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from
temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of
transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic
time lag between infection and death.
  In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al
2020, Report #13, Imperial College London] to include (a) population saturation
effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more
balanced prior on intervention effects and (d) partial pooling of the lockdown
intervention covariate. We also (e) included another 3 countries (Greece, the
Netherlands and Portugal).
  The model code is available at
https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model/
  We are now reporting the results of our updated model online at
https://mrc-ide.github.io/covid19estimates/
  We estimated parameters jointly for all M=14 countries in a single
hierarchical model. Inference is performed in the probabilistic programming
language Stan using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.

    <title>Generalized logistic growth modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak in 29
  provinces in China and in the rest of the world</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 has been successfully contained in China but is spreading all
over the world. We calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized
logistic growth model, the generalized Richards model and the generalized
growth model to the reported number of infected cases from for the whole of
China, 29 provinces in China, and 19 countries and regions that are undergoing
major outbreaks. We dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the
impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within
each province. We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China
with a detailed analysis on the heterogeneous situations across provinces. The
extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some
instructive variations across provinces. Borrowing from the experience of
China, we made scenario projections on the development of the outbreak in other
countries. We identified that Europe and US have passed the inflection point
and entered into an after-peak trajectory, which is estimated longer than what
a classical Logistic model predicts, in contrast to most provinces in China
where the after-peak trajectory is much faster. We expect Europe to have 1.83
million final total confirmed cases (2452 per million population) and US to
have 1.26 million final total confirmed cases (3851 per million population). We
identified three groups of countries in different level of outbreak progress,
and provide informative implications for the current global pandemic.

    <title>The propagation of the economic impact through supply chains: The case
  of a mega-city lockdown against the spread of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  This study quantifies the economic effect of a possible lockdown of Tokyo to
prevent spread of COVID-19. The negative effect of the lockdown may propagate
to other regions through supply chains because of shortage of supply and
demand. Applying an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly 1.6
million firms in Japan, we simulate what would happen to production activities
outside Tokyo when production activities that are not essential to citizens'
survival in Tokyo were shut down for a certain period. We find that when Tokyo
is locked down for a month, the indirect effect on other regions would be twice
as large as the direct effect on Tokyo, leading to a total production loss of
27 trillion yen in Japan, or 5.3% of its annual GDP. Although the production
shut down in Tokyo accounts for 21% of the total production in Japan, the
lockdown would result in a reduction of the daily production in Japan by 86% in
a month.

    <title>Comparison of different exit scenarios from the lock-down for COVID-19
  epidemic in the UK and assessing uncertainty of the predictions</title>
    <summary>  We model further development of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK given the
current data and assuming different scenarios of handling the epidemic. In this
research, we further extend the stochastic model suggested in \cite{us} and
incorporate in it all available to us knowledge about parameters characterising
the behaviour of the virus and the illness induced by it. The models we use are
flexible, comprehensive, fast to run and allow us to incorporate the following:
-time-dependent strategies of handling the epidemic; -spatial heterogeneity of
the population and heterogeneity of development of epidemic in different areas;
-special characteristics of particular groups of people, especially people with
specific medical pre-histories and elderly.
  Standard epidemiological models such as SIR and many of its modifications are
not flexible enough and hence are not precise enough in the studies that
requires the use of the features above. Decision-makers get serious benefits
from using better and more flexible models as they can avoid of nuanced
lock-downs, better plan the exit strategy based on local population data,
different stages of the epidemic in different areas, making specific
recommendations to specific groups of people; all this resulting in a lesser
impact on economy, improved forecasts of regional demand upon NHS allowing for
intelligent resource allocation.

    <title>Informative Ranking of Stand Out Collections of Symptoms: A New
  Data-Driven Approach to Identify the Strong Warning Signs of COVID 19</title>
    <summary>  We develop here a data-driven approach for disease recognition based on given
symptoms, to be efficient tool for anomaly detection. In a clinical setting and
when presented with a patient with a combination of traits, a doctor may wonder
if a certain combination of symptoms may be especially predictive, such as the
question, "Are fevers more informative in women than men?" The answer to this
question is, yes. We develop here a methodology to enumerate such questions, to
learn what are the stronger warning signs when attempting to diagnose a
disease, called Conditional Predictive Informativity, (CPI), whose ranking we
call CPIR. This simple to use process allows us to identify particularly
informative combinations of symptoms and traits that may help medical field
analysis in general, and possibly to become a new data-driven advised approach
for individual medical diagnosis, as well as for broader public policy
discussion. In particular we have been motivated to develop this tool in the
current enviroment of the pressing world crisis due to the COVID 19 pandemic.
We apply the methods here to data collected from national, provincial, and
municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online, and
then curated to an online publically available Github repository.

    <title>Inferring the effective fraction of the population infected with
  Covid-19 from the behaviour of Lombardy, Madrid and London relative to the
  remainder of Italy, Spain and England</title>
    <summary>  I use a very simple deterministic model for the spread of Covid-19 in a large
population. Using this to compare the relative decay of the number of deaths
per day between different regions in Italy, Spain and England, each applying in
principle the same social distancing procedures across the whole country, I
obtain an estimate of the total fraction of the population which had already
become infected by April 10th. In the most heavily affected regions, Lombardy,
Madrid and London, this fraction is higher than expected, i.e. $\approx 0.3$.
This result can then be converted to a determination of the infection fatality
rate $ifr$, which appears to be $ifr \approx 0.0025-0.005$, and even smaller in
London, somewhat lower than usually assumed. Alternatively, the result can also
be interpreted as an effectively larger fraction of the population than simple
counting would suggest if there is a variation in susceptibility to infection
with a variance of up to a value of about 2. The implications are very similar
for either interpretation or for a combination of effects.

    <title>Analytical and numerical investigation of the airflow in face masks used
  for protection against COVID-19 virus -- implications for mask design and
  usage</title>
    <summary>  The use of face masks for the general public has been suggested in literature
as a means to decrease virus transmission during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
However, literature findings indicate that most mask designs do not provide
reliable protection. This paper investigates the hypothesis that the impaired
protection is mainly due to imperfect fitting of the masks, so that airflow,
which contains virus-transporting droplets, can leak through gaps into or out
of the mask. The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical
and numerical computations. The results demonstrate that the flow can be
satisfactorily predicted by simplified analytical 1D-flow models, by efficient
2D-flow simulations and by 3D-flow simulations. The present results show that
already gap heights larger than 0.1mm can result in the mask not fulfilling
FFP2 or FFP3 standards, and for gap heights of ca. 1mm most of the airflow and
droplets may pass through the gap. The implications of these findings are
discussed and improvements to existing mask designs are suggested.

    <title>Simulation-free estimation of an individual-based SEIR model for
  evaluating nonpharmaceutical interventions with an application to COVID-19 in
  Iowa</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmingly demonstrated the need to
accurately evaluate the effects of implementing new or altering existing
nonpharmaceutical interventions. Since these interventions applied at the
societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means,
public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and
mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are
typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most
epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been
shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative
approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive
and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of
expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know
the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window
using limited resources. This paper presents an estimation algorithm for an IBM
designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive
relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological
outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network. We
utilize our methods to evaluate the effects of relaxing current social
distancing measures in Iowa, USA, at various times and to various degrees.
\verb!R! code for our method is provided in the supplementary material, thereby
allowing others to utilize our approach for other regions.

    <title>Virtual Screening of Plant Metabolites against Main protease,
  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2: Therapeutics
  option of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Covid-19, a serious respiratory complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become
one of the global threat to human healthcare system. The present study
evaluated the possibility of plant originated approved 117 therapeutics against
the main protease protein (MPP), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike
protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 including drug surface analysis by using molecular
docking through drug repurposing approaches. The molecular interaction study
revealed that Rifampin (-16.3 kcal/mol) were topmost inhibitor of MPP where
Azobechalcone were found most potent plant therapeutics for blocking the RdRp
(-15.9 kcal /mol) and S (-14.4 kcal/mol) protein of SARS-CoV-2. After the
comparative analysis of all docking results, Azobechalcone, Rifampin,
Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline were exhibited as the most
potential inhibitory plant compounds for targeting the key proteins of
SARS-CoV-2. However, amino acid positions; H41, C145, and M165 of MPP played
crucial roles for the drug surface interaction where F368, L371, L372, A375,
W509, L514, Y515 were pivotal for RdRP. In addition, the drug interaction
surface of S proteins also showed similar patterns with all of its maximum
inhibitors. ADME analysis also strengthened the possibility of screened plant
therapeutics as the potent drug candidates against SARS-C with the highest drug
friendliness.

    <title>A new SEIR type model including quarantine effects and its application
  to analysis of Covid-19 pandemia in Poland in March-April 2020</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing and quarantine are well established non-pharmaceutical
epidemic control tools. The paper aims to clarify the impact of these measures
in COVID-19 epidemic. A new deterministic model is introduced (SEIRQ:
susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed, quarantined) with Q compartment
capturing individuals and releasing them with delay. We obtain a simple rule
defining the reproduction number $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of quarantine
parameters, ratio of diagnosed cases and transmission parameters. The model is
applied to the epidemic in Poland in March - April 2020, when social distancing
measures were in place. We investigate 3 scenarios corresponding to different
ratios of diagnosed cases. Our results show that depending on the scenario
contact tracing could have prevented from 50\% to over 90\% of cases. The
effects of quarantine are limited by fraction of undiagnosed cases. Taking into
account the transmission intensity in Poland prior to introduction of social
restrictions it is unlikely that the control of the epidemic could be achieved
without any social distancing measures.

    <title>Pipeline for Advanced Contrast Enhancement (PACE) of chest X-ray in
  evaluating COVID-19 patients by combining bidimensional empirical mode
  decomposition and CLAHE</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 is a new pulmonary disease which is driving stress to the hospitals
due to the large number of cases worldwide. Imaging of lungs can play a key
role in monitoring of the healthy status. Non-contrast chest computed
tomography (CT) has been used for this purpose, mainly in China, with a
significant success. However, this approach cannot be used massively mainly for
both high risk and cost and in some countries also because this tool is not
extensively available. Alternatively, chest X-ray, although less sensitive than
CT-scan, can provide important information about the evolution of pulmonary
involvement during the disease, this aspect is very important to verify the
response of a patient to treatments. Here, we show how to improve the
sensitivity of chest X-ray via a nonlinear post processing tool, named PACE,
combining properly fast and adaptive bidimensional empirical mode decomposition
and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The results show
an enhancement of the image contrast as confirmed by three widely used metrics:
(i) contrast improvement index, (ii) entropy, and (iii) measure of enhancement.
This improvement gives rise to a detectability of more lung lesions as
identified by two radiologists, which evaluate the images separately, and
confirmed by CT-scans. Based on our findings this method is proved as a
flexible and effective way for medical image enhancement and can be used as a
post-processing step for medical image understanding and analysis.

    <title>Reconfiguring health services to reduce the workload of caregivers
  during the COVID-19 outbreak using an open-source scalable platform for
  remote digital monitoring and coordination of care in hospital Command
  Centres</title>
    <summary>  The Covid-19 outbreak threatens to saturate healthcare systems in most
Western countries. We describe how digital technologies may be used to
automatically and remotely monitor patients at home. Patients answer simple
self-reported questionnaires and their data is transmitted, in real time, to a
Command Centre in the nearest reference hospital. Patient reported data are
automatically filtered by algorithms to identify those with early warning
signs. Open-source code of all software components required to deploy the
remote digital monitoring platform and Command Centres is available.

    <title>Crucial Inflammatory Mediators and Efficacy of Drug Interventions in
  Pneumonia Inflated COVID-19: An Invivo Mathematical Modelling Study</title>
    <summary>  The virus SARS-COV-2 caused disease COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by
WHO. Currently, over 210 countries and territories have been affected. Careful,
well-designed drugs and vaccine for the total elimination of this virus seem to
be the need of the hour. In this context, the invivo mathematical modelling
studies can be extremely helpful in understanding the efficacy of the drug
interventions. These studies can also help understand the role of the crucial
inflammatory mediators and the behaviour of immune response towards this novel
coronavirus. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we study the invivo
dynamics of Covid-19. The results obtained here are inline with some of the
clinical findings for Covid-19. This invivo modelling study involving the
crucial biomarkers of Covid-19 is the first of its kind and the results
obtained from this can be helpful to researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians
and doctors who are working in this field.

    <title>How to restart? An agent-based simulation model towards the definition
  of strategies for COVID-19 "second phase" in public buildings</title>
    <summary>  Restarting public buildings activities in the "second phase" of COVID-19
emergency should be supported by operational measures to avoid a second virus
spreading. Buildings hosting the continuous presence of the same users and
significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices,
universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with
infectors. Beside individual's risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial
masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants' load
limitation (towards "social distancing") and access control. Simulators could
support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an
Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built
environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate
occupants' movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and
exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations.
Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies
and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data
("Diamond Princess" cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part
of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning
the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to
reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable
infected people's number. The building capacity limitation could support such
measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by
occupants (thus improving users' comfort issues). A preliminary model to
combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density combination is proposed. The
model could be modified to consider other recurring scenarios in other public
buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).

    <title>In-Ear Measurement of Blood Oxygen Saturation: An Ambulatory Tool Needed
  To Detect The Delayed Life-Threatening Hypoxaemia in COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  Non-invasive ambulatory estimation of blood oxygen saturation has emerged as
an important clinical requirement to detect hypoxemia in the delayed
post-infective phase of COVID-19, where dangerous hypoxia may occur in the
absence of subjective breathlessness. This immediate clinical driver, combined
with the general quest for more personalised health data, means that pulse
oximetry measurement of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will likely expand
into both the clinical and consumer market of wearable health technology in the
near future. In this study, we set out to establish the feasibility of SpO2
measurement from the ear canal as a convenient site for long term monitoring,
and perform a comprehensive comparison with the right index finger - the
conventional clinical measurement site. During resting SpO2 estimation, we
found a root mean square difference of 1.47% between the two measurement sites,
with a mean difference of 0.23% higher SpO2 in the right ear canal. Through the
simultaneous recording of pulse oximetry from both the right ear canal and
index finger during breath holds, we observe a substantial improvement in
response time between the ear and finger that has a mean of 12.4 seconds and a
range of 4.2 - 24.2 seconds across all subjects. Factors which influence this
response time, termed SpO2 delay, such as the sex of a subject are also
explored. Furthermore, we examine the potential downsides of ear canal blood
oxygen saturation measurement, namely the lower photoplethysmogram amplitude,
and suggest ways to mitigate this disadvantage. These results are presented in
conjunction with previously discovered benefits such as robustness to
temperature, making the case for measurement of SpO2 from the ear canal being
both convenient and superior to conventional finger measurement sites for
continuous non-intrusive long term monitoring in both clinical and
everyday-life settings.

    <title>A Modified Epidemiological Model to Understand the Uneven Impact of
  COVID-19 on Vulnerable Individuals and the Approaches Required to Help them
  Emerge from Lockdown</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has shown a relatively low mortality rate in young healthy
individuals, with the majority of this group being asymptomatic or having mild
symptoms, while the severity of the disease among individuals with underlying
health conditions has caused signiffcant mortality rates worldwide.
Understanding these differences in mortality amongst different sectors of
society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk and
vulnerabilities to be determined to enable strategies exit the lockdown.
However, epidemiological models do not account for the variability encountered
in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups.
To overcome this limitation, it is proposed that a modiffed SEIR model, namely
SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding
their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the
spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to
different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A
Monte Carlo simulation indicates a large number of deaths could be avoided by
slightly decreasing the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. From this
modelling a number of mechanisms can be proposed to limit the exposure of
vulnerable individuals to the disease in order to reduce the mortality rate
among this group. One option could be the provision of a wristband to
vulnerable people and those without a contact-tracing app. By combining very
dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with
information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be
protected and kept safer. Widespread utilisation would extend the protection
further beyond these high risk groups.

    <title>User Concerns &amp; Tradeoffs in Technology-Facilitated Contact Tracing</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing apps are one of the primary technology-facilitated
Coronavirus (COVID) responses currently proposed. In the majority of Western
nations there is the expectation that citizens will have the autonomy to decide
whether or not to install a COVID-related app. Yet, the more users who install
a COVID app, the greater the impact on public health. As explained by Chan et
al. the value of users installing a contact-tracing app grows quadratically
with the number of users who install. How can we get users to install COVID
apps? By understanding and mitigating user concerns and tradeoffs.
  This document provides a framework for considering the user-relevant
components of COVID apps and corresponding user tradeoffs related to these
apps. Specifically, we enumerate user tradeoffs related to data collection,
data quality, identifier/data encryption, privacy invasion, mobile costs, user
agency, benefits from app use, and app transparency. We break down which
tradeoffs are relevant for which contact tracing implementations (centralized
vs. decentralized, location- vs. proximity-based). Additionally, we compare
contact tracing to an alternative technology-facilitated COVID solution:
narrowcasts. Narrowcasts are location-personalized broadcasts about COVID
hotspots in your vicinity.

    <summary>  The present ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is creating
havoc across the world. The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive
drug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effective
tools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, named
as COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an
announcement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective
from the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been ever
undertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This study
aims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a
kinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was
further constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India in
order to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) true
state wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infection
distribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii)
realistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements
patterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across different
geographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19
outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World
Health Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix)
incubation period as per WHO report. This model does not attempt to make a
long-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis; but to
compare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). In
the framework of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significant
success of the lockdown in containing the disease within a tiny fraction of the
population and in the absence of it, it would have led to a very grave
situation.

    <title>Covid-19: Automatic detection from X-Ray images utilizing Transfer
  Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  In this study, a dataset of X-Ray images from patients with common pneumonia,
Covid-19, and normal incidents was utilized for the automatic detection of the
Coronavirus. The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures proposed over
recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure
called transfer learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of
various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target,
often yielding remarkable results. The dataset utilized in this experiment is a
collection of 1427 X-Ray images. 224 images with confirmed Covid-19, 700 images
with confirmed common pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions are
included. The data was collected from the available X-Ray images on public
medical repositories. With transfer learning, an overall accuracy of 97.82% in
the detection of Covid-19 is achieved.

    <title>COVID-19 in air suspensions</title>
    <summary>  We analyse the stability of virus-carrying particles in air at equilibrium
after the dissipation of the initial turbulent process produced by sneezing,
coughing, breathing or speaking.
  Because the viruses are expelled mainly attached to small droplets, with
diverse sizes and weights, and the external environmental conditions can also
be diverse, the subsequent motion spannes different spatial and temporal
scales.
  For droplet sizes larger than $100\,\mu m$, computing the time of decay to
the ground and the distance travelled with a simple free fall model with
empirical data extracted from the literature, we obtain distances in the range
between $1$ to $3$ meters from the emitter, with a falling time of less than
$1\,s$, similar to known recommendations for safe social distancing. For
droplets sizes less than $100\,\mu m$ a simple model of motion in a viscous
medium predicts that isolated viruses could remain suspended in quiet air for
more than a month, while small droplets of $1\,\mu m$ in size can remain
suspended for several hours, in agreement with recent experimental results on
virus stability in aerosols. These results give solid background for the
discussion of prevention strategies, like the use of masks in closed
environments.

    <title>Fever and mobility data indicate social distancing has reduced incidence
  of communicable disease in the United States</title>
    <summary>  In March of 2020, many U.S. state governments encouraged or mandated
restrictions on social interactions to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease
caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has spread to nearly 180
countries. Estimating the effectiveness of these social-distancing strategies
is challenging because surveillance of COVID-19 has been limited, with tests
generally being prioritized for high-risk or hospitalized cases according to
temporally and regionally varying criteria. Here we show that reductions in
mobility across U.S. counties with at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led
to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a
mean lag of 6.5 days ($90\%$ within 3--10 days) that is consistent with the
incubation period of COVID-19. Furthermore, counties with larger decreases in
mobility subsequently achieved greater reductions in fevers ($p&lt;0.01$), with
the notable exception of New York City and its immediate vicinity. These
results indicate that social distancing has reduced the transmission of
influenza like illnesses, including COVID 19, and support social distancing as
an effective strategy for slowing the spread of COVID-19.

    <title>Unleashing the power of disruptive and emerging technologies amid
  COVID-19: A detailed review</title>
    <summary>  The unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), during early
December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has quickly evolved into a global pandemic,
became a matter of grave concern, and placed government agencies worldwide in a
precarious position. The scarcity of resources and lack of experiences to
endure the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the fear of future consequences has
established the need for adoption of emerging and future technologies to
address the upcoming challenges. Since the last five months, the amount of
pandemic impact has reached its pinnacle that is altering everyone's life; and
humans are now bound to adopt safe ways to survive under the risk of being
affected. Technological advances are now accelerating faster than ever before
to stay ahead of the consequences and acquire new capabilities to build a safer
world. Thus, there is a rising need to unfold the power of emerging, future and
disruptive technologies to explore all possible ways to fight against COVID-19.
In this review article, we attempt to study all emerging, future, and
disruptive technologies that can be utilized to mitigate the impact of
COVID-19. Building on background insights, detailed technological specific use
cases to fight against COVID-19 have been discussed in terms of their
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). As concluding
remarks, we highlight prioritized research areas and upcoming opportunities to
blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological domain-specific
challenges and also illuminate collaborative research directions for moving
towards a post-COVID-19 world.

    <title>Short-term predictions and prevention strategies for COVID-2019: A model
  based study</title>
    <summary>  An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing
till December 2019. As of March 16 2020, It has caused an epidemic outbreak
with more than 1,79,073 confirmed infections and 7,074 reported deaths
worldwide. During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is
established and reported cases of coronavirus disease (COVID) are rising
worldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance for health care planning and
control the virus with limited resource. In this study, we propose and analyze
a compartmental epidemic model of COVID to predict and control the outbreak.
The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated
analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to
observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit
daily data from five provinces of China namely, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan,
Zhejiang and Hunan. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining
human-to-human spread ($R_0&gt;1$, $R_c&gt;1$) is already present in all the five
provinces. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID
cases is well captured by the model for all the five provinces. However, long
term predictions for Hubei reveals that the symptomatic COVID cases will show
oscillatory behaviour. Further, we found that effective management of
quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated
individuals to reduce the disease burden. Numerical results show that the
modification factor for quarantine, modification factor for isolation and
transmission rate are quite effective in reduction of the COVID cases in Hubei.
Thus, COVID is controllable by reducing contacts with infected people and
increasing the efficiency of quarantine and isolation. Health care officials
should supply medications, protective masks and necessary human resources in
the affected areas.

    <title>Large-scale ligand-based virtual screening for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors
  using deep neural networks</title>
    <summary>  Due to the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there is an urgent need for novel therapies and drugs.
We conducted a large-scale virtual screening for small molecules that are
potential CoV-2 inhibitors. To this end, we utilized "ChemAI", a deep neural
network trained on more than 220M data points across 3.6M molecules from three
public drug-discovery databases. With ChemAI, we screened and ranked one
billion molecules from the ZINC database for favourable effects against CoV-2.
We then reduced the result to the 30,000 top-ranked compounds, which are
readily accessible and purchasable via the ZINC database. Additionally, we
screened the DrugBank using ChemAI to allow for drug repurposing, which would
be a fast way towards a therapy. We provide these top-ranked compounds of ZINC
and DrugBank as a library for further screening with bioassays at
https://github.com/ml-jku/sars-cov-inhibitors-chemai.

    <title>Understanding the COVID19 Outbreak: A Comparative Data Analytics and
  Study</title>
    <summary>  The Coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 virus, has emerged in Wuhan China
since late November 2019. Since that time, it has been spreading at large-scale
until today all around the world. It is currently recognized as the world's
most viral and severe epidemic spread in the last twenty years, as compared to
Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003. Despite being still in the middle of the
outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of COVID-19. The
objective is to clarify how it was spread so fast in a short time worldwide in
unprecedented fashion. This paper represents a first initiative to achieve this
goal, and it provides a comprehensive analytical study about the Coronavirus.
The contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and predictive
models that give insights into COVID-19 impact through the analysis of
extensive data updated daily for the outbreak in all countries. We aim at
answering several open questions: How does COVID-19 spread around the world?
What is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent,
region, and country levels? How does its severity compare with other epidemic
outbreaks, including Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a
correlation between the number of confirmed cases and death cases? We present a
comprehensive analytics visualization to address the questions mentioned above.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic analytical papers
that pave the way towards a better understanding of COVID-19. The analytical
dashboards and collected data of this study are available online [1].

    <title>Predicting inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using
  machine learning and virtual screening</title>
    <summary>  Global coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by newly identified
SARS- CoV-2 coronavirus continues to claim the lives of thousands of people
worldwide. The unavailability of specific medications to treat COVID-19 has led
to drug repositioning efforts using various approaches, including computational
analyses. Such analyses mostly rely on molecular docking and require the 3D
structure of the target protein to be available. In this study, we utilized a
set of machine learning algorithms and trained them on a dataset of
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors to run inference analyses on
antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs solely based on the ligand information.
We also performed virtual screening analysis of the drug candidates predicted
by machine learning models and docked them against the active site of SARS-
CoV-2 RdRp, a key component of the virus replication machinery. Based on the
ligand information of RdRp inhibitors, the machine learning models were able to
identify candidates such as remdesivir and baloxavir marboxil, molecules with
documented activity against RdRp of the novel coronavirus. Among the other
identified drug candidates were beclabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the
hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp enzyme, and HCV protease inhibitors paritaprevir
and faldaprevir. Further analysis of these candidates using molecular docking
against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed low binding energies against the enzyme
active site. Our approach also identified anti-inflammatory drugs lupeol,
lifitegrast, antrafenine, betulinic acid, and ursolic acid to have potential
activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We propose that the results of this study are
considered for further validation as potential therapeutic options against
COVID-19.

    <title>Effects of social distancing and isolation on epidemic spreading: a
  dynamical density functional theory model</title>
    <summary>  For preventing the spread of epidemics such as the coronavirus disease
COVID-19, social distancing and the isolation of infected persons are crucial.
However, existing reaction-diffusion equations for epidemic spreading are
incapable of describing these effects. We present an extended model for disease
spread based on combining an SIR model with a dynamical density functional
theory where social distancing and isolation of infected persons are explicitly
taken into account. The model shows interesting nonequilibrium phase separation
associated with a reduction of the number of infections, and allows for new
insights into the control of pandemics.

    <title>MeSH descriptors indicate the knowledge growth in the
  SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The scientific papers dealing with the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by this virus, published in 2020
and recorded in the database PUBMED, were retrieved on April 27, 2020. About
20\% of the records contain Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), keywords assigned
to records in the course of the indexing process in order to summarise the
articles' contents. The temporal sequence of the first occurrences of the
keywords was determined, thus giving insight into the growth of the knowledge
base of the pandemic.

    <title>Inbetweening auto-animation via Fokker-Planck dynamics and thresholding</title>
    <summary>  We propose an equilibrium-driven deformation algorithm (EDDA) to simulate the
inbetweening transformations starting from an initial image to an equilibrium
image, which covers images varying from a greyscale type to a colorful type on
plane or manifold. The algorithm is based on Fokker-Planck dynamics on
manifold, which automatically cooperates positivity, unconditional stability,
mass conservation law, exponentially convergence and also the manifold
structure suggested by dataset. The thresholding scheme is adapted for the
sharp interface dynamics and is used to achieve the finite time convergence.
Using EDDA, three challenging examples, (I) facial aging process, (II)
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) invading/treatment process, and (III)
continental evolution process are conducted efficiently.

    <title>Controlling Propagation of epidemics via mean-field games</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing and impacting
lives on a global scale. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field game model in
controlling the propagation of epidemics on a spatial domain. The control
variable, the spatial velocity, is first introduced for the classical disease
models, such as the SIR model. For this proposed model, we provide fast
numerical algorithms based on proximal primal-dual methods. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed model illustrates how to separate
infected patients in a spatial domain effectively.

    <title>Potential Neutralizing Antibodies Discovered for Novel Corona Virus
  Using Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  The fast and untraceable virus mutations take lives of thousands of people
before the immune system can produce the inhibitory antibody. Recent outbreak
of novel coronavirus infected and killed thousands of people in the world.
Rapid methods in finding peptides or antibody sequences that can inhibit the
viral epitopes of COVID-19 will save the life of thousands. In this paper, we
devised a machine learning (ML) model to predict the possible inhibitory
synthetic antibodies for Corona virus. We collected 1933 virus-antibody
sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response and trained an ML
model to predict the antibody response. Using graph featurization with variety
of ML methods, we screened thousands of hypothetical antibody sequences and
found 8 stable antibodies that potentially inhibit COVID-19. We combined
bioinformatics, structural biology, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to
verify the stability of the candidate antibodies that can inhibit the Corona
virus.

    <title>Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists for preventing acute respiratory
  distress syndrome and death from cytokine storm syndrome</title>
    <summary>  In severe viral pneumonias, including Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
the viral replication phase is often followed by a hyperinflammatory reaction
('cytokine storm syndrome') that leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome
and death, despite maximal supportive care. Preventing hyperinflammation is key
to avoiding these outcomes. We previously demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic
receptor antagonists ($\alpha$-blockers) can prevent cytokine storm syndrome
and death in mice. Here, we conduct a retrospective analysis of patients with
acute respiratory distress or pneumonia (n = 13,125 and n = 108,956,
respectively) from all causes; patients who were incidentally taking
$\alpha$-blockers had a reduced risk of requiring ventilation (by 35% and 16%,
respectively), and a reduced risk of being ventilated and dying (by 56% and
20%, respectively), compared to non-users. Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists
had no significant effects. These results highlight the urgent need for
prospective trials testing whether prophylactic $\alpha$-blockers improve
outcomes in diseases with a prominent hyperinflammatory component such as
COVID-19.

    <title>The differential expression of the ACE2 receptor across ages and gender
  explains the differential lethality of SARS-Cov-2 and suggests possible
  therapy</title>
    <summary>  The fatality rate of SARS-Cov-2 escalates with age and is larger in men than
women. I show that these variations are strongly correlated with the levels of
the ACE2 protein in the lungs but surprisingly, despite ACE2 is the viral
receptor, higher levels lead to lower fatality. This behaviour is consistent
with a previous mathematical model that predicts that the speed of viral
progression in the organism has a maximum and then declines with the receptor
level. SARS-Cov-2 degrades ACE2 and thus worsens lung injury, causes
vasoconstriction, thrombotic problems, and exacerbated inflammatory response. I
developed a mathematical model based on the influence of ACE2 on viral
propagation and on the negative effects of its degradation. The model fits
SARS-CoV-2 fatality rate across age and gender with high accuracy ($r^2&gt;0.9$).
Rescaling the model parameters with the binding rates of the spike proteins of
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 allows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across
age and gender, in particular its higher severity for young patients, thus
linking the molecular and epidemiological levels. These results support the
suggestion that drugs that enhance the expression of ACE2, such as ACE
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, constitute a promising therapy
against the most adverse effects of CoViD-19. Furthermore, ACE2 is a candidate
prognostic factor for detecting population that needs stronger protection.

    <title>Transitioning out of the Coronavirus Lockdown: A Framework for
  Zone-Based Social Distancing</title>
    <summary>  In the face of elevated pandemic risk, is it necessary to completely lock
down the population, imposing extreme social distancing? Canonical
epidemiological models suggest this may be unavoidable for months at a time,
despite the heavy social and human cost of physically isolating people.
Alternatively, people could retreat into socially or economically defined
defensive zones, with more interactions inside their zone than across zones.
Starting from a complete lockdown, zones could facilitate responsible reopening
of education, government, and firms, as a well-implemented structure can
dramatically slow the diffusion of the disease. This paper provides a framework
for understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of zones for social
distancing.

    <title>Coronavirus Contact Tracing: Evaluating The Potential Of Using Bluetooth
  Received Signal Strength For Proximity Detection</title>
    <summary>  We report on measurements of Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) received signal
strength taken on mobile handsets in a variety of common, real-world settings.
We note that a key difficulty is obtaining the ground truth as to when people
are in close proximity to one another. Knowledge of this ground truth is
important for accurately evaluating the accuracy with which contact events are
detected by Bluetooth LE. We approach this by adopting a scenario-based
approach. In summary, we find that the Bluetooth LE received signal strength
can vary substantially depending on the relative orientation of handsets, on
absorption by the human body, reflection/absorption of radio signals in
buildings and trains. Indeed we observe that the received signal strength need
not decrease with increasing distance. This suggests that the development of
accurate methods for proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal
strength is likely to be challenging. Our measurements also suggest that
combining use of Bluetooth LE contact tracing apps with adoption of new social
protocols may yield benefits but this requires further investigation. For
example, placing phones on the table during meetings is likely to simplify
proximity detection using received signal strength. Similarly, carrying
handbags with phones placed close to the outside surface. In locations where
the complexity of signal propagation makes proximity detection using received
signal strength problematic entry/exit from the location might instead be
logged in an app by e.g. scanning a time-varying QR code or the like.

    <title>ICT Intervention in the Containment of the Pandemic Spread of COVID-19:
  An Exploratory Study</title>
    <summary>  The objective of this article is to explore the Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) interventions and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats for the containment of the pandemic spread of novel Coronavirus. The
research adopted a qualitative research approach, while the study data were
collected through online content review and Focus Group Discussion (FGD).
Starting with a preliminary set of about 1200 electronic resources or contents,
56 were selected for review study, applying an inclusion and exclusion
criteria. The review study revealed ICT interventions that include websites and
dashboards, mobile applications, robotics and drones, artificial intelligence
(AI), data analytic, wearable and sensor technology, social media and learning
tools, and interactive voice response (IVR) as well as explored their
respective usages to combat the pandemic spread of COVID-19. Later, the FGD was
replicated with 22 participants and explored the possible strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of deploying such technologies to
fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This research not only explores the
exiting status of ICT interventions to fight with the COVID-19 pandemic but
also provides a number of implications for the government, practitioners,
doctors, policymakers and researchers for the effective utilization of the
existing ICT interventions and for the future potential research and
technological development to the containment of the pandemic spread of COVID-19
and future pandemics.

    <title>SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by the numbers</title>
    <summary>  The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that, whether
in a single human host or a wave of infection across continents, viral dynamics
is often a story about the numbers. In this snapshot, our aim is to provide a
one-stop, curated graphical source for the key numbers that help us understand
the virus driving our current global crisis. The discussion is framed around
two broad themes: 1) the biology of the virus itself and 2) the characteristics
of the infection of a single human host. Our one-page summary provides the key
numbers pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, based mostly on peer-reviewed literature. The
numbers reported in summary format are substantiated by the annotated
references below. Readers are urged to remember that much uncertainty remains
and knowledge of this pandemic and the virus driving it is rapidly evolving. In
the paragraphs below we provide "back of the envelope" calculations that
exemplify the insights that can be gained from knowing some key numbers and
using quantitative logic. These calculations serve to improve our intuition
through sanity checks, but do not replace detailed epidemiological analysis.

    <title>Epidemic spreading model of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  We study Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Recovered (SEAIR)
epidemic spreading model inspired by two characteristics of the infectiousness
of COVID-19: delayed start and its appearance before onset of symptoms, or even
with total absence of them. The model is theoretically analyzed in
continuous-time compartmental version and discrete-time version on random
regular graphs and complex networks. We show analytically that there are
relationships between the epidemic thresholds and the equations for the
susceptible populations at the endemic equilibrium in all three versions, which
hold when the epidemic is weak. We provide theoretical arguments that
eigenvector centrality of a node approximately determines its risk to become
infected.

    <title>Old Drugs for Newly Emerging Viral Disease, COVID-19: Bioinformatic
  Prospective</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in late 2019 and 2020 comprises a serious and
more likely a pandemic threat worldwide. Given that the disease has not
approved vaccines or drugs up to now, any efforts for drug design and or
clinical trails of old drugs based on their mechanism of action are worthy and
creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the
newly released coordinate structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and
thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and antibiotics drugs as
ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV-1
protease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based
on their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active
site-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of
interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory
potency of candidates are as follows
Tipranavir&gt;Indinavir&gt;Atazanavir&gt;Darunavir&gt;Ritonavir&gt;Amprenavir for HIV-1
protease inhibitors and Cefditoren&gt;Cefixime&gt;Erythromycin&gt;Clarithromycin for
anti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and
the hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of their
metabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for
their overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey
by clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus
infections.

    <title>Prediction of potential commercially inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 by
  multi-task deep model</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused thousands of
deaths worldwide, and the number of total infections is still rising. However,
the development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few
months. Thus it is urgent to identify some potentially effective old drugs that
can be used immediately. Fortunately, some compounds that can inhibit
coronavirus in vitro have been reported. In this study, the
coronavirus-specific dataset was used to fine-tune our pre-trained multi-task
deep model. Next we used the re-trained model to select available commercial
drugs against targeted proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that abacavir,
a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat HIV,
is predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
Almitrine mesylate and roflumilast which are used for respiratory diseases such
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are also predicted to have inhibitory
effect. Overall, ten drugs are listed as potential inhibitors and the important
sites for these binding by our model are exhibited. We hope these results would
be useful in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.

    <title>The challenges of deploying artificial intelligence models in a rapidly
  evolving pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2, emerged into a world being rapidly transformed by artificial
intelligence (AI) based on big data, computational power and neural networks.
The gaze of these networks has in recent years turned increasingly towards
applications in healthcare. It was perhaps inevitable that COVID-19, a global
disease propagating health and economic devastation, should capture the
attention and resources of the world's computer scientists in academia and
industry. The potential for AI to support the response to the pandemic has been
proposed across a wide range of clinical and societal challenges, including
disease forecasting, surveillance and antiviral drug discovery. This is likely
to continue as the impact of the pandemic unfolds on the world's people,
industries and economy but a surprising observation on the current pandemic has
been the limited impact AI has had to date in the management of COVID-19. This
correspondence focuses on exploring potential reasons behind the lack of
successful adoption of AI models developed for COVID-19 diagnosis and
prognosis, in front-line healthcare services. We highlight the moving clinical
needs that models have had to address at different stages of the epidemic, and
explain the importance of translating models to reflect local healthcare
environments. We argue that both basic and applied research are essential to
accelerate the potential of AI models, and this is particularly so during a
rapidly evolving pandemic. This perspective on the response to COVID-19, may
provide a glimpse into how the global scientific community should react to
combat future disease outbreaks more effectively.

    <title>COVID-19: Social Media Sentiment Analysis on Reopening</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is the most talked topic in social
media platforms in 2020. People are using social media such as Twitter to
express their opinion and share information on a number of issues related to
the COVID-19 in this stay at home order. In this paper, we investigate the
sentiment and emotion of peoples in the United States on the subject of
reopening. We choose the social media platform Twitter for our analysis and
study the Tweets to discover the sentimental perspective, emotional
perspective, and triggering words towards the reopening. During this COVID-19
pandemic, researchers have made some analysis on various social media dataset
regarding lockdown and stay at home. However, in our analysis, we are
particularly interested to analyse public sentiment on reopening. Our major
finding is that when all states resorted to lockdown in March, people showed
dominant emotion of fear, but as reopening starts people have less fear. While
this may be true, due to this reopening phase daily positive cases are rising
compared to the lockdown situation. Overall, people have a less negative
sentiment towards the situation of reopening.

    <title>Finding an Accurate Early Forecasting Model from Small Dataset: A Case
  of 2019-nCoV Novel Coronavirus Outbreak</title>
    <summary>  Epidemic is a rapid and wide spread of infectious disease threatening many
lives and economy damages. It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime
so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing
borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such
curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being
able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important
but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high
uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence
the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another
factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often
scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand,
finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big
challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been
proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel
selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3)
fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest
possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three
virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed...

    <title>Diffusion as a First Model of Spread of Viral Infection</title>
    <summary>  The appearance of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in late 2019 has dominated the
news in the last few months as it developed into a pandemic. In many
mathematics and physics classrooms, instructors are using the time series of
the number of cases to show exponential growth of the infection. In this
manuscript we propose a simple diffusion process as the mode of spreading
infections. This model is less sophisticated than other models in the
literature, but it can capture the exponential growth and it can explain it in
terms of mobility (diffusion constant), population density, and probability of
transmission. Students can change the parameters and determine the growth rate
and predict the total number of cases as a function of time. Students are also
given the opportunity to add other factors that are not considered in the
simple diffusion model.

    <title>The Twitter Social Mobility Index: Measuring Social Distancing Practices
  from Geolocated Tweets</title>
    <summary>  Social distancing is an important component of the response to the novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Minimizing social interactions and travel
reduces the rate at which the infection spreads, and "flattens the curve" such
that the medical system can better treat infected individuals. However, it
remains unclear how the public will respond to these policies. This paper
presents the Twitter Social Mobility Index, a measure of social distancing and
travel derived from Twitter data. We use public geolocated Twitter data to
measure how much a user travels in a given week. We find a large reduction in
travel in the United States after the implementation of social distancing
policies, with larger reductions in states that were early adopters and smaller
changes in states without policies. Our findings are presented on
http://socialmobility.covid19dataresources.org and we will continue to update
our analysis during the pandemic.

    <title>Estimating the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of social
  distancing in the United States</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the number of individuals who have been infected with the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and the extent to which social distancing policies have
been effective at limiting its spread, are critical for effective policy going
forward. Here we present estimates of the extent to which confirmed cases in
the United States undercount the true number of infections, and analyze how
effective social distancing measures have been at mitigating or suppressing the
virus. Our analysis uses a Bayesian model of COVID-19 fatalities with a
likelihood based on an underlying differential equation model of the epidemic.
We provide analysis for four states with significant epidemics: California,
Florida, New York, and Washington. Our short-term forecasts suggest that these
states may be following somewhat different trajectories for growth of the
number of cases and fatalities.

    <title>Noisy Pooled PCR for Virus Testing</title>
    <summary>  Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious
diseases diagnostic tools, like RT-PCR, require substantial resources to test
large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral
status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a
linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as
generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm
estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our
approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than
existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to
various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized.
Finally, in a Utopian world we would have collaborated with RT-PCR experts; it
is difficult to form such connections during a pandemic. We welcome new
collaborators to reach out and help improve this work!

    <title>What are We Depressed about When We Talk about COVID19: Mental Health
  Analysis on Tweets Using Natural Language Processing</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently has affected
human life to a great extent. Besides direct physical and economic threats, the
pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be
overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various
reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus,
and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing
(NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep
models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger,
anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the
EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually
labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods
to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.

    <title>Predicting the evolution Of SARS-Covid-2 in Portugal using an adapted
  SIR Model previously used in South Korea for the MERS outbreak</title>
    <summary>  The new coronavirus covid-19 has spread very quickly worldwide, leading the
World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a state of pandemic. One of the
questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the
spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR
model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also
caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases
in the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct
five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out
of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000
people on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective
and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South
Korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario
1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios
were devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\%
effectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the
transmission rate $\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\%, In this scenario
active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission
rate $\beta$ was reduced to 70\% of its initial value, in which the number of
cases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\beta$
was reduced to 80\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about
~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting
measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the
recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate
measures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully
that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.

    <title>Molecular Characterization of Ebselen Binding Activity to SARS-CoV-2
  Main Protease</title>
    <summary>  The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against this new
virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease
Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against
SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies
have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro
inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a
glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly
attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than
that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying
on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a
molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity.
Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the
catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a
second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region
localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of
the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this
second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic
site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains
exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access
through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and
reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could
interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings
provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro
inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic
strategies for COVID-19.

    <title>SARS-CoV-2 Entry Genes Are Most Highly Expressed in Nasal Goblet and
  Ciliated Cells within Human Airways</title>
    <summary>  The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent responsible for COVID-19
coronavirus disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we
assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the
viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals
generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as
the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut
epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree
reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and
ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells
analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins
towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity.
Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway
epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly
enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways
might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral
pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral
infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the
Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the
compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and
ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2
infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral
transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.

    <title>Expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the spike protein processing
  enzymes in developing human embryos</title>
    <summary>  The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in thousands of critically
ill patients and poses a serious threat globally. To investigate if SARS-CoV-2
can affect early human embryos, we analysed scRNA-seq datasets of human embryos
for the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and BSG (CD147), the serine protease TMPRSS2
for viral spike protein priming, and the endosomal protease CTSL for spike
protein activation via the endosomal route. The results reveal that ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast cells, and both BSG and
CTSL are expressed in all the stages of embryonic development. The cells of the
blastocysts express genes encoding for other coronavirus receptors such as DPP4
and ANPEP as well. Interestingly, the cells of the epiblast also express genes
involved in viral endocytosis and replication. We further identified 194 genes
that are differentially expressed in ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells as
compared to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-negative cells of the epiblast. Our results show
that developing human embryos express the receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronaviruses; embryos also harbour the necessary machinery for viral
internalization and replication. We suggest that couples be advised to avoid
conceiving during the pandemic and that IVF procedures be kept to a minimum to
prevent any possible hazard to the developing embryos.

    <title>Sustaining the economy under partial lockdown: A pandemic centric
  approach</title>
    <summary>  As the world fights to contain and control the spread of the Novel
Coronavirus, countries are imposing severe measures from restrictions on travel
and social gatherings to complete lockdowns. Lockdowns, though effective in
controlling the virus spread, leaves a massive economic impact. In a country
like India with 21.9 % of its population below the poverty line, lockdowns have
a direct impact on the livelihood of a large part of the population. Our
approach conforms to healthcare and state practices of reducing human to human
contact, by optimizing the lockdown strategy. We propose resuming economic
activities while keeping healthcare facilities from being overwhelmed. We model
the coronavirus pandemic as SEIR dynamic model for a set of states as nodes
with certain population and analyze the model output before and after complete
lockdown. Social distancing that people would willingly follow, in the no
lockdown situation is modeled as being influenced with the knowledge of the
current number of infection by imitating Granovetter threshold model. We then
provide optimal lockdown policy solutions for the duration of ten weeks using
NSGA-II optimization algorithm. While there are many studies that focus on
modelling the transmission of COVID-19, ours is one of the few attempts to
strike a balance between number of infections and economic operations.

    <title>Unveiling the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibition
  from 92 crystal structures</title>
    <summary>  Currently, there is no effective antiviral drugs nor vaccine for coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with human
genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorable
drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of
M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity
ranking and prediction of existing structures of M$^{\text{pro}}$-inhibitor
complexes. This work integrates mathematics and deep learning (MathDL) to
provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 92 SARS-CoV-2
M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in
M$^{\text{pro}}$ is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed
by Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bonding
inhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDL
has achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$)
being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curated
SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, which
endows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction. The present
binding affinity ranking, interaction analysis, and fragment decomposition
offer a foundation for future drug discovery efforts.

    <title>Targeting SARS-CoV-2 with AI- and HPC-enabled Lead Generation: A First
  Data Release</title>
    <summary>  Researchers across the globe are seeking to rapidly repurpose existing drugs
or discover new drugs to counter the the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One
promising approach is to train machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) tools to screen large numbers of small molecules. As a
contribution to that effort, we are aggregating numerous small molecules from a
variety of sources, using high-performance computing (HPC) to computer diverse
properties of those molecules, using the computed properties to train ML/AI
models, and then using the resulting models for screening. In this first data
release, we make available 23 datasets collected from community sources
representing over 4.2 B molecules enriched with pre-computed: 1) molecular
fingerprints to aid similarity searches, 2) 2D images of molecules to enable
exploration and application of image-based deep learning methods, and 3) 2D and
3D molecular descriptors to speed development of machine learning models. This
data release encompasses structural information on the 4.2 B molecules and 60
TB of pre-computed data. Future releases will expand the data to include more
detailed molecular simulations, computed models, and other products.

    <title>Containment efficiency and control strategies for the Corona pandemic
  costs</title>
    <summary>  The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) confronts policy makers with
the problem of measuring the effectiveness of containment strategies and the
need to balance public health considerations with the economic costs of a
persistent lockdown. We introduce a modified epidemic model, the controlled-SIR
model, in which the disease reproduction rate evolves dynamically in response
to political and societal reactions. An analytic solution is presented. The
model reproduces official COVID-19 cases counts of a large number of regions
and countries that surpassed the peak of the outbreak. A single unbiased
feedback parameter is extracted from field data and used to formulate an index
that measures the efficiency of containment policies (the CEI index). CEI
values for a range of countries are given. For two variants of the
controlled-SIR model, detailed estimates of the total medical and
socio-economic costs are evaluated over the entire course of the epidemic.
Costs comprise medical care cost, the economic cost of social distancing, as
well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, strict
measures fare better than a hands-off policy. Strategies based on actual case
numbers lead to substantially higher total costs than strategies based on the
overall history of the epidemic.

    <title>Detecting Suspected Epidemic Cases Using Trajectory Big Data</title>
    <summary>  Emerging infectious diseases are existential threats to human health and
global stability. The recent outbreaks of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 have
rapidly formed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections
and huge economic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track,
detect and isolate infected people are among the most effective means to
quickly contain the outbreak. Based on trajectory provided by the big data and
the mean field theory, we establish an aggregated risk mean field that contains
information of all risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal
model named HiRES risk map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high
computation efficiency enabling fast update. We then propose an objective
individual epidemic risk scoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps,
and use it to develop statistical inference and machine learning methods for
detecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical
experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of
COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in
capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be
applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community
levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as hospital and
station. HiRES-p score seems to be an effective measurement of personal
epidemic risk. The accuracy of both detecting methods are above 90\% when the
population infection rate is under 20\%, which indicates great application
potential in epidemic risk prevention and control practice.

    <title>Exploring the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host-drug interactome for drug
  repurposing</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in Wuhan, China, and has since spread
causing a global pandemic. Various studies have been performed to understand
the molecular mechanisms of viral infection for predicting drug repurposing
candidates. However, such information is spread across many publications and it
is very time-consuming to access, integrate, explore, and exploit. We developed
CoVex, the first interactive online platform for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 host
interactome exploration and drug (target) identification. CoVex integrates 1)
experimentally validated virus-human protein interactions, 2) human
protein-protein interactions and 3) drug-target interactions. The web interface
allows user-friendly visual exploration of the virus-host interactome and
implements systems medicine algorithms for network-based prediction of drugs.
Thus, CoVex is an important resource, not only to understand the molecular
mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, but also in
clinical research for the identification and prioritization of candidate
therapeutics. We apply CoVex to investigate recent hypotheses on a systems
biology level and to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms driving
the virus life cycle. Furthermore, we extract and discuss drug repurposing
candidates involved in these mechanisms. CoVex renders COVID-19 drug research
systems-medicine-ready by giving the scientific community direct access to
network medicine algorithms integrating virus-host-drug interactions. It is
available at https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/covex/.

    <title>CODA-19: Reliably Annotating Research Aspects on 10,000+ CORD-19
  Abstracts Using a Non-Expert Crowd</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces CODA-19, a human-annotated dataset that codes the
Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, and Other sections of 10,966
English abstracts in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. CODA-19 was created by
248 crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk within 10 days, achieving a label
quality comparable to that of experts. Each abstract was annotated by nine
different workers, and the final labels were obtained by majority vote. The
inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa) between the crowd and the biomedical
expert (0.741) is comparable to inter-expert agreement (0.788). CODA-19's
labels have an accuracy of 82.2% when compared to the biomedical expert's
labels, while the accuracy between experts was 85.0%. Reliable human
annotations help scientists to understand the rapidly accelerating coronavirus
literature and also serve as the battery of AI/NLP research, but obtaining
expert annotations can be slow. We demonstrated that a non-expert crowd can be
rapidly employed at scale to join the fight against COVID-19.

    <title>COVID-19: The unreasonable effectiveness of simple models</title>
    <summary>  When the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) was officially
declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the scientific community had
already braced up in the effort of making sense of the fast-growing wealth of
data gathered by national authorities all over the world. However, despite the
diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many
widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the
outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show
unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple
universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis
naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to
any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the
testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can
be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate
information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of
the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak,
which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough
in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early
and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries
that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less
deaths overall.

    <title>Some numerical observations about the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy</title>
    <summary>  We give some numerical observations on the total number of infected by the
SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. The analysis is based on a tanh formula involving two
parameters. A polynomial correlation between the parameters gives an upper
bound for the time of the peak of new infected. A numerical indicator of the
temporal variability of the upper bound is introduced. The result and the
possibility to extend the analysis to other countries are discussed in the
conclusions.

    <title>Future of COVID-19 in Italy: A mathematical perspective</title>
    <summary>  We have proposed an SEIR compartmental mathematical model. The prime
objective of this study is to analyze and forecast the pandemic in Italy for
the upcoming months. The basic reproduction number has been calculated. Based
on the current situation in Italy, in this paper, we will estimate the possible
time for the end of the pandemic in the country. The impact of lockdown and
rapid isolation on the spread of the pandemic are also discussed. Further, we
have studied four of the most pandemic affected regions in Italy. Using the
proposed model, a prediction has been made about the duration of pandemic in
these regions. The variation in the basic reproduction number corresponding to
the sensitive parameters of the model is also examined.

    <title>Epidemic parameters for COVID-19 in several regions of India</title>
    <summary>  Bayesian analysis of publicly available time series of cases and fatalities
in different geographical regions of India during April 2020 is reported. It is
found that the initial apparent rapid growthin infections could be partly due
to confounding factors such as initial rapid ramp-up of disease surveillance. A
brief discussion is given of the fallacies which arise if this possibility is
neglected. The growth after April 10 is consistent with a time independent but
region dependent exponential. From this, R0 is extracted using both known cases
and fatalities. The two estimates are seen to agree in many cases; for these
CFR is reported. It is seen that CFR and R0 increase together. Some public
health implications of this observation are discussed, including a target
doubling interval if medical facilities are to remain adequate.

    <title>COVID-19 and Your Smartphone: BLE-based Smart Contact Tracing</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing is of paramount importance when it comes to preventing the
spreading of infectious diseases. Contact tracing is usually performed manually
by authorized personnel. Manual contact tracing is an inefficient, error-prone,
time-consuming process of limited utility to the population at large as those
in close contact with infected individuals are informed hours, if not days,
later. This paper introduces an alternative way to manual contact tracing. The
proposed Smart Contact Tracing (SCT) system utilizes the smartphone's Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) signals and machine learning classifier to accurately and
quickly determined the contact profile. SCT's contribution is two-fold: a)
classification of the user's contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity
sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communications
protocol. SCT leverages BLE's non-connectable advertising feature to broadcast
a signature packet when the user is in the public space. Both broadcasted and
observed signatures are stored in the user's smartphone and they are only
uploaded to a secure signature database when a user is confirmed by public
health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength (RSS) each
smartphone estimates its distance from other user's phones and issues real-time
alerts when social distancing rules are violated. The paper includes extensive
experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative
evaluation of five machine learning classifiers. Reported results indicate that
a decision tree classifier outperforms other states of the art classification
methods in terms of accuracy. Lastly, to facilitate research in this area, and
to contribute to the timely development of advanced solutions the entire data
set of six experiments with about 123,000 data points is made publicly
available.

    <title>Unlinking super-linkers: the topology of epidemic response (Covid-19)</title>
    <summary>  A key characteristic of the spread of infectious diseases is their ability to
use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs. This enables the
pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population. In
this work, we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection
rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within
human-contact networks (proximity graphs). Experimental results of disease
spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease
spreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both
significant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability
to place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively
isolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits:
targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into
the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak. It turns out that isolating
super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less
effective than targeting super-links. We highlight the important role of
topology in epidemic outbreaks. We argue that proactive innoculation of a
population by disabling super-links and super-spreaders may have an important
complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a
sophisticated public-health response to epidemic outbreaks.

    <title>A comparative analysis for SARS-CoV-2</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has affected the world tremendously. It is critical that biological
experiments and clinical designs are informed by computational approaches for
time- and cost-effective solutions. Comparative analyses particularly can play
a key role to reveal structural changes in proteins due to mutations, which can
lead to behavioural changes, such as the increased binding of the SARS-CoV-2
surface glycoprotein to human ACE2 receptors. The aim of this report is to
provide an easy to follow tutorial for biologists and others without delving
into different bioinformatics tools. More complex analyses such as the use of
large-scale computational methods can then be utilised. Starting with a
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, the report shows visualising DNA sequence features,
deriving amino acid sequences, and aligning different genomes to analyse
mutations and differences. The report provides further insights into how the
SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein mutated for higher binding affinity to human
ACE2 receptors, compared to the SARS-CoV protein, by integrating existing 3D
protein models.

    <title>COVID-19: Should We Test Everyone?</title>
    <summary>  Since the beginning of 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan, P.R. China, and subsequently, across the
world. The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth
transmissions in which infected patients may be asymptomatic. Undetected
transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus
and pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been
asked by the public is "Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?". While
different regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases,
the screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and
understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The
shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our
ability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians
are facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands.
On one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the
usage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the
patients' frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being
tested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under
investigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical
viewpoint by factoring into the considerations of the uncertainty and
inaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often overlooked by the general
public. We aim to shed light on the tough situation by providing evidence-based
reasoning from the statistical angle, and we expect this examination will help
the general public understand and assess the situation rationally. Most
importantly, the development offers recommendations for physicians to make
sensible evaluations to optimally use the limited resources for the best
medical outcome.

    <title>The covering number of the difference sets in partitions of $G$-spaces
  and groups</title>
    <summary>  We prove that for every finite partition $G=A_1\cup\dots\cup A_n$ of a group
$G$ either $cov(A_iA_i^{-1})\le n$ for all cells $A_i$ or else
$cov(A_iA_i^{-1}A_i)&lt;n$ for some cell $A_i$ of the partition. Here
$cov(A)=\min\{|F|:F\subset G,\;G=FA\}$ is the covering number of $A$ in $G$. A
similar result is proved also of partitions of $G$-spaces. This gives two
partial answers to a problem of Protasov posed in 1995.

    <title>The modelling of COVID19 pathways sheds light on mechanisms,
  opportunities and on controversial interpretations of medical treatments. v2</title>
    <summary>  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV2), inducing the current pandemic
disease (COVID-19) and causing pneumoniae in humans, is dramatically increasing
in epidemic scale since its first appearance in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
The first infection from epidemic coronaviruses in 2003 fostered the spread of
an overwhelming amount of related scientific efforts. The manifold aspects that
have been raised, as well as their redundancy offer precious information that
has been underexploited and needs to be critically re-evaluated, appropriately
used and offered to the whole community, from scientists, to medical doctors,
stakeholders and common people. These efforts will favour a holistic view on
the comprehension, prevention and development of strategies (pharmacological,
clinical etc) as well as common intervention against the new coronavirus
spreading. Here we describe a model that emerged from our analysis that was
focused on the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and the possible routes linking
it to the viral infection. because the infection is mediated by the viral
receptor on human cell membranes Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2), which is
a key component in RAS signalling. The model depicts the main pathways
determining the disease and the molecular framework for its establishment, and
can help to shed light on mechanisms involved in the infection. It promptly
gives an answer to some of the controversial, and still open, issues concerning
predisposing conditions and medical treatments that protect from or favour the
severity of the disease (such as the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs/sartans), or
to the sex related biases in the affected population. The model highlights
novel opportunities for further investigations, diagnosis and appropriate
intervention to understand and fight COVID19.

    <title>Modeling the molecular impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the
  renin-angiotensin system</title>
    <summary>  Infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mediated by the binding of its spike
protein to the membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which
plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The understanding
of RAS dysregulation due to this viral infection is of fundamental importance
to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors of the
coronavirus disease COVID-19, and to design effective therapeutic strategies.
To address this issue, we built a mathematical model of RAS based on data about
protein and peptide concentrations in normotensive and hypertensive
individuals. We first tested our model on clinical data on the action of
antihypertensive RAS-blocking drugs in control individuals. Despite the
simplicity of our model, it reproduces very well, without any fitting of
additional parameters, the impact of a series of drugs, i.e.
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), direct renin inhibitors (DRI)
and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). We applied our model to analyze the
impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the RAS system, which we modeled through a
downregulation of ACE2 related to viral load. Moreover, we analyzed the effect
of RAS-blockers and other RAS-targeting drugs, i.e. human recombinant ACE2
(rhACE2) and angiotensin 1-7 peptide (Ang1-7), on the RAS system of
normotensive and hypertensive COVID-19 patients. We found that while ACE-I,
DRI, rhACE2 and Ang1-7 tend to improve the clinical outcomes in a
tension-dependent manner, the use of ARB appears to worsen it. The mathematical
model that we developed offers the interesting possibility of testing in silico
the RAS dysregulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and of predicting how risk
factors as well as different drugs, alone or in combination, impact on RAS and
disease severity.

    <title>A conjecture on partitions of groups</title>

many cells $G=\bigcup_{n\in\omega}A_n$ such that $cov(A_nA_n^{-1})=|G|$ for

this conjecture for each group of regular cardinality and for some groups (in
particular, Abelian) of an arbitrary cardinality.

    <title>The effect of interurban movements on the spatial distribution of
  population in China</title>
    <summary>  Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of
the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental
ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all
transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results
for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating
the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel
flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial
fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they
appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,
creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These
movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population
concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the
return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us
to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New
Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread
of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of
keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring
intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These
results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national
distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective
control strategies at a national level.

    <title>Masked Face Recognition Dataset and Application</title>
    <summary>  In order to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus, almost everyone
wears a mask during coronavirus epidemic. This almost makes conventional facial
recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access
control, face access control, facial attendance, facial security checks at
train stations, etc. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the recognition
performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces.
Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep
learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present,
there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end,
this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face
Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD)
and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best
of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face
dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on
which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The
multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95%
accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry. Our datasets are
available at: https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset.

    <title>COVID-19: A model for studying the evolution of contamination in Brazil</title>
    <summary>  In the present article we introduce an epidemiological model for the
investigation of the spread of epidemics caused by viruses. The model is
applied specifically to COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus
(aka "novel coronavirus"). The SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model
is used as a basis for studying the evolution of the epidemic. Nevertheless, we
have modified some of the model hypotheses in order to obtain an estimate of
the contamination free of overestimated predictions. This extended model is
then applied to the case of the recent advance of the epidemic in Brazil. In
this regard, it is possible to obtain the evolution for the number of
infectious significantly close to that provided by current data. Accordingly,
we evaluate possible future scenarios for the disease spread. Regarding the
population susceptibility, we consider different social behaviors in response
to quarantine measures and precautions to avoid contagion. We conclude that the
future scenario of the epidemic depends significantly on the social behavior
adopted to date, as well as on the contagion control measures. The extent of
such measures would be likely to cause thousands, millions or tens of millions
of contaminations in the next few months.

    <title>Modeling Epidemic Spreading through Public Transit using Time-Varying
  Encounter Network</title>
    <summary>  Passenger contact in public transit (PT) networks can be a key mediate in the
spreading of infectious diseases. This paper proposes a time-varying weighted
PT encounter network to model the spreading of infectious diseases through the
PT systems. Social activity contacts at both local and global levels are also
considered. We select the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a case study along with smart card data from
Singapore to illustrate the model at the metropolitan level. A scalable and
lightweight theoretical framework is derived to capture the time-varying and
heterogeneous network structures, which enables to solve the problem at the
whole population level with low computational costs. Different control policies
from both the public health side and the transportation side are evaluated. We
find that people's preventative behavior is one of the most effective measures
to control the spreading of epidemics. From the transportation side, partial
closure of bus routes helps to slow down but cannot fully contain the spreading
of epidemics. Identifying "influential passengers" using the smart card data
and isolating them at an early stage can also effectively reduce the epidemic
spreading.

    <title>Identification of a Druggable Intermediate along the Folding Pathway of
  the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2</title>
    <summary>  The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) throughout the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to
identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2
virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one
of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2
(ACE2). Thus, the spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines
and antiviral drugs. We recently described a novel method to pharmacologically
down-regulate the expression of target proteins at the post-translational
level. This technology builds on computational advancements in the simulation
of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by targeting
folding intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the
all-atom simulation of the entire sequence of events underlying the folding
pathway of ACE2. Our data reveal the existence of a folding intermediate
showing druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation. Both pockets were
targeted by a virtual screening repurposing campaign aimed at quickly
identifying drugs capable to decrease the expression of ACE2. Importantly,
among the different virtual hits, we identified mefloquine, a
quinoline-derivative belonging to a class of antimalaria agents (e.g.
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) recently described for their effects on
ACE2 maturation. Thus, our results suggest that these drugs could act against
SARS-CoV-2 by altering the folding pathway of its receptor ACE2.

    <title>Taking the pulse of COVID-19: A spatiotemporal perspective</title>
    <summary>  The sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) swept across the
world in early 2020, triggering the lockdowns of several billion people across
many countries, including China, Spain, India, the U.K., Italy, France,
Germany, and most states of the U.S. The transmission of the virus accelerated
rapidly with the most confirmed cases in the U.S., and New York City became an
epicenter of the pandemic by the end of March. In response to this national and
global emergency, the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center brought together a
taskforce of international researchers and assembled implemented strategies to
rapidly respond to this crisis, for supporting research, saving lives, and
protecting the health of global citizens. This perspective paper presents our
collective view on the global health emergency and our effort in collecting,
analyzing, and sharing relevant data on global policy and government responses,
geospatial indicators of the outbreak and evolving forecasts; in developing
research capabilities and mitigation measures with global scientists, promoting
collaborative research on outbreak dynamics, and reflecting on the dynamic
responses from human societies.

    <title>Course of the first month of the COVID 19 outbreak in the New York State
  counties</title>
    <summary>  We illustrate and study the evolution of reported infections over the month
from March 1st to April 1st in the New York State as a whole, as well as in
each individual county. We search for exponential trends, and try to understand
whether there is any correlation of the timing and dynamics of these trends
with state mandated measures on social distancing and testing. We conclude that
the reports on April 1st may be dramatically under-representing the actual
number of state-wide infections, and we propose reassessment of the data over
the coming weeks, to monitor for effects of the PAUSE directive, and for the
increasing number of casualties as a validating measure.

    <title>Prediction of COVID-19 Disease Progression in India : Under the Effect
  of National Lockdown</title>
    <summary>  In this policy paper, we implement the epidemiological SIR to estimate the
basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ at national and state level. We also
developed the statistical machine learning model to predict the cases ahead of
time. Our analysis indicates that the situation of Punjab
($\mathcal{R}_0\approx 16$) is not good. It requires immediate aggressive
attention. We see the $\mathcal{R}_0$ for Madhya Pradesh (3.37) , Maharastra
(3.25) and Tamil Nadu (3.09) are more than 3. The $\mathcal{R}_0$ of Andhra
Pradesh (2.96), Delhi (2.82) and West Bengal (2.77) is more than the India's
$\mathcal{R}_0=2.75$, as of 04 March, 2020. India's $\mathcal{R}_0=2.75$ (as of
04 March, 2020) is very much comparable to Hubei/China at the early disease
progression stage. Our analysis indicates that the early disease progression of
India is that of similar to China. Therefore, with lockdown in place, India
should expect as many as cases if not more like China. If lockdown works, we
should expect less than 66,224 cases by May 01,2020. All data and \texttt{R}
code for this paper is available from

    <title>A critique of the Covid-19 analysis for India by Singh and Adhikari</title>
    <summary>  In a recent paper (arXiv:2003.12055), Singh and Adhikari present results of
an analysis of a mathematical model of epidemiology based on which they argue
that a $49$ day lockdown is required in India for containing the pandemic in
India. We assert that as a model study with the stated assumptions, the
analysis presented in the paper is perfectly valid, however, any serious
comparison with real data and attempts at prediction from the model are highly
problematic. The main point of the present paper is to convincingly establish
this assertion while providing a warning that the results and analysis of such
mathematical models should not be taken at face value and need to be used with
great caution by policy makers.

    <title>Robust predictive model for Carriers, Infections and Recoveries (CIR):
  first update for CoVid-19 in Spain</title>
    <summary>  This article reports a first update on the assesment of the model previously
presented in arXiv:2003.13890v1. New available data have been used to feed the
model and the comparison with real data still shows good agreement. The main
novelty of the model is that it keeps track of the date of infection of a
single individual and uses stochastic distributions to aggregate individuals
who share the same date of infection. In addition, it uses two types of
infections, mild and serious, with a different recovery time. These features
are implemented in a set of differential equations which determine the number
of Carriers, Infections, Recoveries, Hospitalized and Deaths.

    <title>CO.ME.T.A. -- covid-19 media textual analysis. A dashboard for media
  monitoring</title>
    <summary>  The focus of this paper is to trace how mass media, particularly newspapers,
have addressed the issues about the containment of contagion or the explanation
of epidemiological evolution. We propose an interactive dashboard: CO.ME.T.A..
During crises it is important to shape the best communication strategies in
order to respond to critical situations. In this regard, it is important to
monitor the information that mass media and social platforms convey. The
dashboard allows to explore the mining of contents extracted and study the
lexical structure that links the main discussion topics. The dashboard merges
together four methods: text mining, sentiment analysis, textual network
analysis and latent topic models. Results obtained on a subset of documents
show not only a health-related semantic dimension, but it also extends to
social-economic dimensions.

    <title>Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Antiepidemic Policies and Global
  Situation Assessment of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  With a two-layer contact-dispersion model and data in China, we analyze the
cost-effectiveness of three types of antiepidemic measures for COVID-19:
regular epidemiological control, local social interaction control, and
inter-city travel restriction. We find that: 1) intercity travel restriction
has minimal or even negative effect compared to the other two at the national
level; 2) the time of reaching turning point is independent of the current
number of cases, and only related to the enforcement stringency of
epidemiological control and social interaction control measures; 3) strong
enforcement at the early stage is the only opportunity to maximize both
antiepidemic effectiveness and cost-effectiveness; 4) mediocre stringency of
social interaction measures is the worst choice. Subsequently, we cluster
countries/regions into four groups based on their control measures and provide
situation assessment and policy suggestions for each group.

    <title>COVID-19 Should be Suppressed by Mixed Constraints -- from Simulations
  on Constrained Scale-Free Networks</title>
    <summary>  The spreading of virus infection is here simulated over artificial human
networks. Here, the real-space urban life of people is modeled as a scale-free
network with constraints. A scale-free network has been adopted for modeling
on-line communities so far but is employed here for the aim to represent
peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted
reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. As a result, three
findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the height of the
peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection cases tends to get
reduced corresponding to the upper bound of the size of groups where all
members meet. Second, if we adopt the constraint on m0, the number of all other
people one meets separately each at a time, to the range between 2 and 8, its
effect on the suppression of infections may be weak as far as we allow group
meetings of size W of 8 or larger. Third, such a moderate constraint may
temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage but
it may turn out to be just a delay of peaks. Based on these results, a policy
is proposed here: for quickly suppressing the number of infections, restrict W
to less than 4 if the constraint to make m0 at most 1 is too strict. If W is
set to less than 4, setting m0 to 4 or less works for quick reduction of
infections according to the result.

    <title>Maximising the Benefits of an Acutely Limited Number of COVID-19 Tests</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel testing and containment strategy in order to contain the
spread of SARS-CoV2 while permitting large parts of the population to resume
social and economic activity. Our approach recognises the fact that testing
capacities are severely constrained in many countries. In this setting, we show
that finding the best way to utilise this limited number of tests during a
pandemic can be formulated concisely as an allocation problem. Our problem
formulation takes into account the heterogeneity of the population and uses
pooled testing to identify and isolate individuals while prioritising key
workers and individuals with a higher risk of spreading the disease. In order
to demonstrate the efficacy of our testing and containment mechanism, we
perform simulations using a network-based SIR model. Our simulations indicate
that applying our mechanism on a population of $100,000$ individuals with only
$16$ tests per day reduces the peak number of infected individuals by
approximately $20\%$, when compared to the scenario where no intervention is
implemented.

    <title>In Silico Trial to test COVID-19 candidate vaccines: a case study with
  UISS platform</title>
    <summary>  SARS-CoV-2 is a severe respiratory infection that infects humans. Its
outburst entitled it as a pandemic emergence. To get a grip on this, outbreak
specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must
be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To
promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico
trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and
speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and
minimizing undesired effects. Here, we present an in silico platform that
showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting
SARS- CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has
been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to
design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. UISS is then
potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the
outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2.

    <title>Impact on Mobility and Environmental data of COVID-19 Lockdown on
  Florence Area</title>
    <summary>  According to the changed operative conditions due to lockdown and successive
reopening a number of facts can be analysed. The main effects have been
detected on: mobility, environment, social media and people flows. While in
this first report only mobility, transport and environment are reported. The
analysis performed identified a strong reduction of the mobility and transport
activities, and in the pollutants. The mobility reduction has been assessed to
be quite coherent with respect to what has been described by Google Global
mobility report. On the other hand, in this paper a number of additional
aspects have been put in evidence providing detailed aspects on mobility and
parking that allowed us to better analyze the impact of the reopening on an
eventual revamping of the infection. To this end, the collected data from the
field have been compared from those of google and some considerations with
respect to the Imperial college Report 20 have been derived. For the pollutant
aspects, a relevant reduction on most of them has been measured and rationales
are reported.

    <title>GeoCoV19: A Dataset of Hundreds of Millions of Multilingual COVID-19
  Tweets with Location Information</title>
    <summary>  The past several years have witnessed a huge surge in the use of social media
platforms during mass convergence events such as health emergencies, natural or
human-induced disasters. These non-traditional data sources are becoming vital
for disease forecasts and surveillance when preparing for epidemic and pandemic
outbreaks. In this paper, we present GeoCoV19, a large-scale Twitter dataset
containing more than 524 million multilingual tweets posted over a period of 90
days since February 1, 2020. Moreover, we employ a gazetteer-based approach to
infer the geolocation of tweets. We postulate that this large-scale,
multilingual, geolocated social media data can empower the research communities
to evaluate how societies are collectively coping with this unprecedented
global crisis as well as to develop computational methods to address challenges
such as identifying fake news, understanding communities' knowledge gaps,
building disease forecast and surveillance models, among others.

    <title>A quantitative framework for exploring exit strategies from the COVID-19
  lockdown</title>
    <summary>  Following the highly restrictive measures adopted by many countries for
combating the current pandemic, the number of individuals infected by
SARS-CoV-2 and the associated number of deaths is steadily decreasing. This
fact, together with the impossibility of maintaining the lockdown indefinitely,
raises the crucial question of whether it is possible to design an exit
strategy based on quantitative analysis. Guided by rigorous mathematical
results, we show that this is indeed possible: we present a robust numerical
algorithm which can compute the cumulative number of deaths that will occur as
a result of increasing the number of contacts by a given multiple, using as
input only the most reliable of all data available during the lockdown, namely
the cumulative number of deaths.

    <title>The identification of spatially constrained homogeneous clusters of
  Covid-19 transmission</title>
    <summary>  The paper introduces an approach to identify a set of spatially constrained
homogeneous areas maximally homogeneous in terms of epidemic trends. The
proposed hierarchical algorithm is based on the Dynamic TimeWarping distances
between epidemic time trends where units are constrained by a spatial proximity
graph. The paper includes two different applications of this approach to Italy,
based on different data (number of positive test and number of differential
deaths, with respect to the previous years) and on different observational
units (provinces and Labour Market Areas). Both applications, above all the one
related to Labour Market Areas, show the existence of well-defined areas, where
the dynamics of growth of the infection have been strongly differentiated. The
adoption of the same lock-down policy throughout the entire national territory
has been therefore sub-optimal, showing once again the urgent need for local
data-driven policies.

    <title>Modulation of COVID-19 Epidemiology by UV-B and -A Photons from the Sun</title>
    <summary>  Solar UV-C photons do not reach Earth's surface, but are known to be endowed
with germicidal properties that are also effective on viruses. The effect of
softer UV-B/A photons, which reach the Earth$'$s surface, on viruses are
instead little studied and highly debated. Here we show that the evolution and
strength of the recent SARS-Cov-2 pandemics, might have been modulated by the
intensity of UV-B/A Solar radiation hitting different regions of Earth during
the diffusion of the outbreak. Our results suggest that Solar UV-B/A may play
an important role in planning new strategies of confinement of the epidemics.

    <title>Change points in the spread of COVID-19 question the effectiveness of
  interventions in Germany</title>
    <summary>  This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical
interventions towards SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany. Using dates of
infection estimated from official case data, exponential growth models for
infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with
respect to change points. Clear evidence is found of a decline of infections at
the beginning of March, which can be attributed to relatively small
interventions and voluntary behavioral changes. The effects of later
interventions remain unclear. Liberalizations of measures did not induce a
re-increase of infections. These results contradict previous studies on the
German case. The study also exhibits three methodological challenges with
respect to assessing of interventions: a) the estimation of true infection
dates, b) the usage of several indicators and c) the influence of test volume.
In conclusion, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains
questionable.

    <title>COVID-19 dynamic model: Balanced identification of general biological
  and country specific social features</title>
    <summary>  Breaking a complex bio-social phenomenon (epidemic) into its components,
considering the processes that determine its dynamics, formalizing the accepted
hypotheses in mathematical equations, selecting appropriate experimental and
statistical material, and constructing a mathematical model - those are typical
tasks of scientific research. A specific data processing method (balanced
identification) and appropriate information technology made it possible to
consider a number of models, determine the general biological laws of the
virus-human interaction (common to all populations), and the country specific
social features of epidemic management in the countries (or cities) under
consideration. As the initial data, only new cases are used. Data from
different countries is taken from official sources and processed in a uniform
way. The obtained estimates of the number of undetected infected are lower
estimates.

    <title>Optimisation of non-pharmaceutical measures in COVID-19 growth via
  neural networks</title>
    <summary>  This study seeks to quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating
viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On 19 March, the World Health Organisation
declared a pandemic. Through this global spread, many nations have witnessed
exponential growth of confirmed cases brought under control by severe mass
quarantine or lockdown measures. However, some nations have, through a
different timeline of actions, prevented this exponential growth. Currently
whilst some continue to tackle exponential growth, others attempt to safely
lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. To quantify the impact of
government actions and support existing theories as well as policy makers, a
data-driven model is developed. Data for two nations, Italy and Taiwan, is
gathered and used to train several neural networks. The results of the
best-performing model, the Long Short Term Neural Network, are optimized to
investigate a different scenario of mitigation measures for both nations. It is
found a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter border control benefit
both nations by resulting in significantly less confirmed cases. Interestingly,
this scenario couples with an earlier but milder implementation of nationwide
restrictions for Italy, thus supporting Taiwan's lack of a nationwide lockdown

    <title>Expected Utility Optimization - Calculus of Variations Approach</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, I'll derive the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation for Merton's
problem in Utility Optimization Theory using a Calculus of Variations (CoV)
Approach. For stochastic control problems, Dynamic Programming (DP) has been
used as a standard method. To the best of my knowledge, no one has used CoV for
this problem. In addition, while the DP approach cannot guarantee that the
optimum satisfies the HJ equation, the CoV approach does.
  Be aware that this is the first draft of this paper and many flaws might be
introduced.

    <title>Deep CNNs Meet Global Covariance Pooling: Better Representation and
  Generalization</title>
    <summary>  Compared with global average pooling in existing deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), global covariance pooling can capture richer statistics of
deep features, having potential for improving representation and generalization
abilities of deep CNNs. However, integration of global covariance pooling into
deep CNNs brings two challenges: (1) robust covariance estimation given deep
features of high dimension and small sample; (2) appropriate use of geometry of
covariances. To address these challenges, we propose a global Matrix Power
Normalized COVariance (MPN-COV) Pooling. Our MPN-COV conforms to a robust
covariance estimator, very suitable for scenario of high dimension and small
sample. It can also be regarded as power-Euclidean metric between covariances,
effectively exploiting their geometry. Furthermore, a global Gaussian embedding
method is proposed to incorporate first-order statistics into MPN-COV. For fast
training of MPN-COV networks, we propose an iterative matrix square root
normalization, avoiding GPU unfriendly eigen-decomposition inherent in MPN-COV.
Additionally, progressive 1x1 and group convolutions are introduced to compact
covariance representations. The MPN-COV and its variants are highly modular,
readily plugged into existing deep CNNs. Extensive experiments are conducted on
large-scale object classification, scene categorization, fine-grained visual
recognition and texture classification, showing our methods are superior to the
counterparts and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

    <title>Splitting one ventilator for multiple patients -- a technical assessment</title>
    <summary>  Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, many efforts and innovative solutions
have surfaced to deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon
catastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves splitting one ventilator
to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are
obvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients
with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs
of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but
that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different
compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility
of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments
expanding on the previous studies using two types of test lungs, different
ventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs
connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were
measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances,
modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found
discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs proportional
with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway
resistances, and that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also
change the tidal volume delivered to the other test lung when in volume
controlled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that higher PEEP
settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test
lungs. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to
identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the
hazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is indicated for
mitigating risks.

    <title>Modelling the Extremes of Seasonal Viruses and Hospital Congestion: The
  Example of Flu in a Swiss Hospital</title>
    <summary>  Viruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as
"seasonal viruses" as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words,
meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this
information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In
this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals
in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from
patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We
propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of
positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds
of positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these
distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations
to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological
conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar
variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings
highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a
related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under
different meteorological conditions. The relevant numerical computations can be
easily carried out using the freely available GJRM R package. The introduced
approach could be applied to several types of seasonal disease data such as
those derived from the new virus SARS-CoV-2 and its COVID-19 disease which is
at the moment wreaking havoc worldwide. The empirical effectiveness of the
proposed method is assessed through a simulation study.

    <title>Towards computer-aided severity assessment: training and validation of
  deep neural networks for geographic extent and opacity extent scoring of
  chest X-rays for SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity</title>
    <summary>  Background: A critical step in effective care and treatment planning for
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the assessment
of the severity of disease progression. Chest x-rays (CXRs) are often used to
assess SARS-CoV-2 severity, with two important assessment metrics being extent
of lung involvement and degree of opacity. In this proof-of-concept study, we
assess the feasibility of computer-aided scoring of CXRs of SARS-CoV-2 lung
disease severity using a deep learning system.
  Materials and Methods: Data consisted of 130 CXRs from SARS-CoV-2 positive
patient cases from the Cohen study. Geographic extent and opacity extent were
scored by two board-certified expert chest radiologists (with 20+ years of
experience) and a 2nd-year radiology resident. The deep neural networks used in
this study are based on a COVID-Net network architecture. 100 versions of the
network were independently learned (50 to perform geographic extent scoring and
50 to perform opacity extent scoring) using random subsets of CXRs from the
Cohen study, and evaluated the networks using stratified Monte Carlo
cross-validation experiments.
  Findings: The deep neural networks yielded R$^2$ of 0.673 $\pm$ 0.004 and
0.636 $\pm$ 0.002 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for
geographic extent and opacity extent, respectively, in stratified Monte Carlo
cross-validation experiments. The best performing networks achieved R$^2$ of
0.865 and 0.746 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic
extent and opacity extent, respectively.
  Interpretation: The results are promising and suggest that the use of deep
neural networks on CXRs could be an effective tool for computer-aided
assessment of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity, although additional studies are
needed before adoption for routine clinical use.

    <title>Mechanobiology predicts raft formations triggered by ligand-receptor
  activity across the cell membrane</title>
    <summary>  Clustering of ligand-binding receptors of different types on thickened isles
of the cell membrane, namely lipid rafts, is an experimentally observed
phenomenon. Although its influence on cell response is deeply investigated, the
role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving
the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding
has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which regulate specific cell processes
through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between
the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the
intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by Multidrug Resistance
Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based
on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass
balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and
kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon
both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and
of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell
membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering
of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active
receptors -in agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels- and how the
latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current
scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often
serve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for
strong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in
better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell
interaction.

    <title>Possibility of Disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in Human
  Respiratory Tract by Controlled Ethanol Vapor Inhalation</title>
    <summary>  Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza are lipophilic, enveloped viruses,
and are relatively easy to inactivate by exposure to alcohols. The envelope
mainly consists of the lipid bilayer, taken from the host cells at
assembly/budding stage of the viral life cycle. Therefore the constitution of
the lipid bilayer should be common in all SARS, MERS and influenza viruses,
even after mutations, and thus these closely-related viruses will be
disinfected by exposure to ethanol with the same concentration. Existing
experimental data indicate that an ethanol concentration of 30~40 v/v% is
sufficient to inactivate Influenza-A viruses in solution[1,2,3]. The author
suggests that it may be possible to use alcoholic beverages of 16~20 v/v%
concentration for this disinfection process, such as Whisky (1:1 hot water
dilution) or Japanese Sake, because they are readily available and safe
(non-toxic). By inhaling the alcohol vapor at 50~60$^\circ$C (122~140$^\circ$F)
through the nose for one or two minutes, it will condense on surfaces inside
the respiratory tract; mainly in the nasal cavity. The alcohol concentration
will be intensified to ~36 v/v% by this process, which is enough to disinfect
the corona virus on the mucous membrane. This method also provides more
moisture into respiratory tract, and helps to clean the inside of the nasal
cavity by stimulating blowing of the nose, and also makes the mucous escalator
work actively so that the self-clearing mechanism in the trachea will remove
viruses faster. An alternative prompt method is also discussed. We use 40 v/v%
whisky or similar alcohol, dripping on a gauze, inhale the vapor slowly at room
temperature. This method works well for the front part of the nasal cavity.
This is suitable for clinical workers, because they may need to use prompt
preventative measures at any time.

    <title>Covid Notions: Towards Formal Definitions -- and Documented
  Understanding -- of Privacy Goals and Claimed Protection in Proximity-Tracing
  Services</title>
    <summary>  The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gave rise to management approaches using
mobile apps for contact tracing. The corresponding apps track individuals and
their interactions, to facilitate alerting users of potential infections well
before they become infectious themselves. Naive implementation obviously
jeopardizes the privacy of health conditions, location, activities, and social
interaction of its users. A number of protocol designs for colocation tracking
have already been developed, most of which claim to function in a privacy
preserving manner. However, despite claims such as "GDPR compliance",
"anonymity", "pseudonymity" or other forms of "privacy", the authors of these
designs usually neglect to precisely define what they (aim to) protect. We make
a first step towards formally defining the privacy notions of proximity tracing
services, especially with regards to the health, (co-)location, and social
interaction of their users. We also give a high-level intuition of which
protection the most prominent proposals can and cannot achieve. This initial
overview indicates that all proposals include some centralized services, and
none protects identity and (co-)locations of infected users perfectly from both
other users and the service provider.

    <title>Forecasting the outcome and estimating the epidemic model parameters
  from the fatality time series in COVID-19 outbreaks</title>
    <summary>  In the absence of other tools, monitoring the effects of protective measures,
including social distancing and forecasting the outcome of outbreaks is of
immense interest. Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic
errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of
empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In
this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a
master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic
reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection
rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable
differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities.
We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows
this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic
growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic
reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the
outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The
difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the
separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal
variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model
remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.

    <title>The TVBG-SEIR spline model for analysis of COVID-19 spread, and a Tool
  for prediction scenarios</title>
    <summary>  Mathematical models are traditionally used to analyze the long-term global
evolution of epidemics, to determine the potential and severity of an outbreak,
and to provide critical information for identifying the type of disease
interventions and intensity. One of the widely used mathematical models of
long-term spreading of epidemics are the so-called deterministic compartmental
models (SIR/SEIR type models). One of the main purposes of applying such models
is to assess how the expensive restriction measures imposed by the authorities
(home and social isolation/quarantine, travel restrictions, etc.) can
effectively reduce the control reproduction number of the disease and its
transmission risk. However the classical SIR/SEIR models have been primarily
studied in what may be called stationary case, where the main parameters, the
Transmission rate Beta (reflecting the virus spread by infected individuals)
and the Removed rate Gamma (reflecting the hospitalization/isolation measures)
remain constant during the whole period of interest. Hence, it is important to
extend the classical SIR/SEIR models by creating new ansatzes for the dynamics
of the transmission rates Beta(t) (which we will call further just Beta) and
removed rates Gamma(t) (which we will call further just Gamma). The main
purpose of the present research is to introduce a spline-based SEIR model with
Time-varying Beta and Gamma parameters, or abbreviated TVBG-SEIR model, which
is used to estimate the practical implications of the public health
interventions and measures. We have designed a Tool based on the TVBG-SEIR
model, which may be used as a Decision Support Tool to assist the health
decision- and policy-makers in creating predictive scenarios.

    <title>Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of COVID-19 outbreak severity
  with the use of meta-projections based on Richards' curve parameters</title>
    <summary>  Researchers have shown that even simple empirical models stemming from
biological growth modeling have the potential to provide useful information on
the development and severity of ongoing epidemics since they can be employed as
tools for carrying out projections on the size of the affected population,
timing of turning points, as well as best- and worst-case scenarios.
Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input
parameters' variance which results in large fluctuations in the generated
projections, thus rendering predictions difficult and even risky. In this work
we examine a novel meta-projections-based approach which allows us to evaluate
the model's current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a
transient or stable state. Meta-projections can be extracted from graphs of
successive estimations of model's parameters and resulting projections, over a
sequence of days being gradually added to the employed model. In other words,
projections are carried out on truncated time series of cumulative numbers of
confirmed cases with increased lengths at each successive evaluation. This
allows us to trace the values of model parameters over a certain period of time
and examine their trends which may converge to specific values for
settled-growth cases or exhibit a changing or even an erratic behavior for
cases that undergo epidemiological transitions and/or are inappropriately
described by the current model instance(s). We have computed meta-projections
and compared our findings for countries at different stages of the epidemic
with stable or unstable behaviors and increasing or decreasing numbers of
confirmed cases. Our results indicate that meta-projections can aid researchers
in assessing the appropriateness of their relevant models and in effect
decrease the uncertainty in their estimations of an epidemic's severity and
development.

    <title>What Can We Estimate from Fatality and Infectious Case Data? A case
  Study of Covid-19 Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Daily case reports and daily fatalities for China, South Korea, France,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Iran, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States
over the period January 22, 2020 - April 20, 2020 are analysed using the
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each country, the
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models fitting cumulative infective case
data within 5% error are analysed. It is shown that the quantity that can be
the most robustly estimated from the normalized data, is the timing of the
maximum and timings of the inflection points of the proportion of infected
individuals.

    <title>Nota Técnica dos Modelos Implementados pelo Coletivo Covid19br para
  Projeções de Cenários Futuros da Pandemia COVID-19 no Brasil</title>
    <summary>  This technical note aims to provide a brief introduction to the projection
models used by the group to project future scenarios for states and
municipalities in real-time, according to the disease's behavior in previous
days. However, the parameters can be modified by the user to design customized
scenarios. The proposed model begins with the calculation of the basic
reproduction number for the state or municipality based on the incidence of
cases in the last 12 days. Once this is done, the epidemiological curve is
projected using the SEIR compartmentalized epidemic model, in possession of
this curve, part of the newly projected infected enter a simulation model for
health systems in queuing theory, aiming to project future occupations and
collapses.

    <title>Interplay of social distancing and border restrictions for pandemics
  (COVID-19) via the epidemic Renormalisation Group framework</title>
    <summary>  We demonstrate that the epidemic renormalisation group approach to pandemics
provides an effective and simple way to investigate the dynamics of disease
transmission and spreading across different regions of the world. The framework
also allows for reliable projections on the impact of travel limitations and
social distancing measures on global epidemic spread. We test and calibrate it
on reported cases while unveiling the mechanism that governs the delay in the
relative peaks of newly infected cases among different regions of the globe. We
discover that social distancing measures are more effective than travel
limitations across borders in delaying the epidemic peak. We further provide
the link to compartmental models such as the simplistic and time-honoured
SIR-like models. We also show how to generalise the framework to account for
the interactions across several regions of the world, replacing or
complementing large scale simulations.

    <title>In silico ADMET and molecular docking study on searching potential
  inhibitors from limonoids and triterpenoids for COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The computational strategies like molecular docking, simulation, in silico
ADMET and drug-likeness prediction were adopted to search potential compounds
that can inhibit the effects of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the published
literatures on medicinal importance, total 154 phytochemicals with analogous
structure from limonoids and triterpenoids were selected to search potential
inhibitors for the five protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., 3CLpro (main
protease), PLpro (papain like protease), SGp-RBD (spike glycoprotein-receptor
binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase, ACE2 (angiotensin
converting enzyme 2). Analyses of the in silico computational results and
reported medicinal uses, the phytochemicals such as
7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, epoxyazadiradione, limonin, maslinic acid,
glycyrrhizic acid and ursolic acid were found to be effective against the
target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed
that these phytochemicals bind at the main active site of the target proteins.
Therefore, the core structure of these potential hits can be used for further
lead optimization to design drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Also, the plants extracts
like neem, tulsi, citrus and olives containing these phytochemicals can be used
to formulate suitable therapeutics approaches in traditional medicines.

    <title>Analyzing the Impact of Covid-19 Control Policies on Campus Occupancy
  and Mobility via Passive WiFi Sensing</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of virus has resulted in many different policies being enacted
across the world to reduce the spread of the virus. These efforts range from
increased social awareness and social distancing (Sweden) to full country-wide
lockdowns (Singapore, most of Europe, many states in the US). The effectiveness
of various policies in containing the spread of the disease is still being
studied by researchers. In this paper, using WiFi data collected directly from
the infrastructure, we present a detailed analysis of the impact of virus
related policies on the staff and students of three different college campuses.
Two of these campuses are in Singapore, while the third is in the Northeastern
United States. Our study focuses on two different key metrics, 1) Occupancy,
defined as the number of people in a building, on average, in a specific hour,
and 2) Mobility, defined as the number of places visited by an individual, on
average, in a specific hour. We use these two metrics since they provide a
strong indicator of how likely it is for virus to spread if there is an
outbreak. Our results show that online learning, split-team, and other space
management policies are effective at lowering Occupancy. However, they do not
change the Mobility patterns for individuals who are still moving around.
Reducing Mobility requires introducing strict stay-at-home or lockdown orders,
but doing so increases Occupancy in residential spaces. We present our results
and then discuss the implications of the findings for policymakers.

    <title>Is Second-order Information Helpful for Large-scale Visual Recognition?</title>
    <summary>  By stacking layers of convolution and nonlinearity, convolutional networks
(ConvNets) effectively learn from low-level to high-level features and
discriminative representations. Since the end goal of large-scale recognition
is to delineate complex boundaries of thousands of classes, adequate
exploration of feature distributions is important for realizing full potentials
of ConvNets. However, state-of-the-art works concentrate only on deeper or
wider architecture design, while rarely exploring feature statistics higher
than first-order. We take a step towards addressing this problem. Our method
consists in covariance pooling, instead of the most commonly used first-order
pooling, of high-level convolutional features. The main challenges involved are
robust covariance estimation given a small sample of large-dimensional features
and usage of the manifold structure of covariance matrices. To address these
challenges, we present a Matrix Power Normalized Covariance (MPN-COV) method.
We develop forward and backward propagation formulas regarding the nonlinear
matrix functions such that MPN-COV can be trained end-to-end. In addition, we
analyze both qualitatively and quantitatively its advantage over the well-known
Log-Euclidean metric. On the ImageNet 2012 validation set, by combining MPN-COV
we achieve over 4%, 3% and 2.5% gains for AlexNet, VGG-M and VGG-16,
respectively; integration of MPN-COV into 50-layer ResNet outperforms
ResNet-101 and is comparable to ResNet-152. The source code will be available
on the project page: http://www.peihuali.org/MPN-COV

    <title>A non-classical class of variational problems</title>
    <summary>  We study a new non-classical class of variational problems that is motivated
by some recent research on the non-linear revenue problem in the field of
economics. This class of problem can be set up as a maximising problem in the
Calculus of Variations (CoV) or Optimal Control. However, the state value at
the final fixed time, y(T), is a priori unknown and the integrand is a function
of the unknown y(T). This is a non-standard CoV problem. In this paper we apply
the new costate boundary conditions p(T) in the formulation of the CoV problem.
We solve some sample examples in this problem class using the numerical
shooting method to solve the resulting TPBVP, and incorporate the free y(T) as
an additional unknown. Essentially the same results are obtained using symbolic
algebra software.

    <title>The number of translates of a closed nowhere dense set required to cover
  a Polish group</title>
    <summary>  For a Polish group G let cov_G be the minimal number of translates of a fixed
closed nowhere dense subset of G required to cover G. For many locally compact
G this cardinal is known to be consistently larger than cov(meager) which is
the smallest cardinality of a covering of the real line by meagre sets. It is
shown that for several non-locally compact groups cov_G=cov(meager). For
example the equality holds for the group of permutations of the integers, the
additive group of a separable Banach space with an unconditional basis and the
group of homeomorphisms of various compact spaces.

    <title>Estimation of the variance of partial sums of dependent processes</title>
    <summary>  We study subsampling estimators for the limit variance \[
  \sigma^2=Var(X_1)+2 \sum_{k=2}^\infty Cov(X_1,X_k) \] of partial sums of a
stationary stochastic process $(X_k)_{k\geq 1}$. We establish $L_2$-consistency
of a non-overlapping block resampling method. Our results apply to processes
that can be represented as functionals of strongly mixing processes. Motivated
by recent applications to rank tests, we also study estimators for the series
$Var(F(X_1))+2 \sum_{k=2}^\infty Cov(F(X_1),F(X_k))$, where $F$ is the
distribution function of $X_1$. Simulations illustrate the usefulness of the
proposed estimators and of a mean squared error optimal rule for the choice of
the block length.

    <title>Decomposing Baire class 1 functions into continuous functions</title>
    <summary>  Let dec be the least cardinal kappa such that every function of first Baire
class can be decomposed into kappa continuous functions. Cichon, Morayne,
Pawlikowski and Solecki proved that cov(Meager) &lt;= dec &lt;= d and asked whether
these inequalities could, consistently, be strict. By cov(Meager) is meant the
least number of closed nowhere dense sets required to cover the real line and
by d is denoted the least cardinal of a dominating family in omega^omega.
Steprans showed that it is consistent that cov(Meager) not= dec. In this paper
we show that the second inequality can also be made strict. The model where dec
is different from d is the one obtained by adding omega_2 Miller - sometimes
known as super-perfect or rational-perfect - reals to a model of the Continuum
Hypothesis. It is somewhat surprising that the model used to establish the
consistency of the other inequality, cov(Meager) not= dec, is a slight
modification of the iteration of super-perfect forcing.

    <summary>  We prove the consistency of: for suitable strongly inaccessible cardinal
lambda the dominating number, i.e. the cofinality of lambda^lambda is strictly
bigger than cov(meagre_lambda), i.e. the minimal number of nowhere dense
subsets of 2^lambda needed to cover it. This answers a question of Matet.

    <title>Note on $s_0$ nonmeasurable unions</title>
    <summary>  In this note we consider an arbitrary families of sets of $s_0$ ideal
introduced by Marczewski-Szpilrajn. We show that in any uncountable Polish
space $X$ and under some combinatorial and set theoretical assumptions
($cov(s_0)=\c$ for example), that for any family $\ca\subseteq s_0$ with
$\bigcup\ca =X$, we can find a some subfamily $\ca'\subseteq\ca$ such that the
union $\bigcup\ca'$ is not $s$-measurable. We have shown a consistency of the
$cov(s_0)=\omega_1&lt;\c$ and existence a partition of the size $\omega_1$ $\ca\in
[s_0]^{\omega}$ of the real line $\bbr$, such that there exists a subfamily
$\ca'\subseteq\ca$ for which $\bigcup\ca'$ is $s$-nonmeasurable. We also showed
that it is relatively consistent with ZFC theory that $\omega_1&lt;\c$ and
existence of m.a.d. family $\ca$ such that $\bigcup\ca$ is $s$-nonmeasurable in
Cantor space $2^\omega$ or Baire space $\omega^\omega$. The consistency of
$a&lt;cov(s_0)$ and $cov(s_0)&lt;a$ is proved also.

    <title>On the effectiveness of imposing restrictive measures in a graded
  Self-Organized Criticality epidemic spread model The case of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  The scope of this work is to serve as a guiding tool against subjective
estimations on real pandemic situations (mainly due to the inability to acquire
objective real data over whole populations). The previously introduced model of
closed self-organized criticality (SOC), is adapted in the case of a
virus-induced epidemic. In this version this physical model can distinguish the
virus spread according to the virus aggressiveness. The study presented,
highlights the critical value of virus density over a population. For low
values of the initial virus density (lower than the critical value) it is
proved that the virus-diffusion behavior is safe and quantitatively similar to
usual real epidemical data. However, it is revealed that very close to the
critical point, the critical slowing-down (CSD) phenomenon, introduced by the
theory of critical phenomena, emerges, leading to a tremendous increase of both
the percentage of active carriers and the duration of the epidemic. A behavior
of the epidemic obeying to a second order phase transition, also occurs. For
virus density values higher than the critical value, the epidemic duration
becomes extremely prolonged. Additionally, the effect of the closed system
population size revealed interesting properties. All these results, together
with an investigation of the effectiveness of applying physical contact
restriction measures, document scientifically their worthiness, while they also
demonstrate the limits for which herd immunity holds safely. Finally, the model
has been compared against real epidemic data in the case of Greece, which
imposed restrictive measures consistently and in time.

    <title>Mobile phone data analytics against the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy:
  flow diversity and local job markets during the national lockdown</title>
    <summary>  Understanding collective mobility patterns is crucial to plan the restart of
production and economic activities, which are currently put in stand-by to
fight the diffusion of the epidemics. In this report, we use mobile phone data
to infer the movements of people between Italian provinces and municipalities,
and we analyze the incoming, outcoming and internal mobility flows before and
during the national lockdown (March 9th, 2020) and after the closure of
non-necessary productive and economic activities (March 23th, 2020). The
population flow across provinces and municipalities enable for the modelling of
a risk index tailored for the mobility of each municipality or province. Such
an index would be a useful indicator to drive counter-measures in reaction to a
sudden reactivation of the epidemics. Mobile phone data, even when aggregated
to preserve the privacy of individuals, are a useful data source to track the
evolution in time of human mobility, hence allowing for monitoring the
effectiveness of control measures such as physical distancing. We address the
following analytical questions: How does the mobility structure of a territory
change? Do incoming and outcoming flows become more predictable during the
lockdown, and what are the differences between weekdays and weekends? Can we
detect proper local job markets based on human mobility flows, to eventually
shape the borders of a local outbreak?

    <title>A note on 'Collider bias undermines our understanding of COVID-19
  disease risk and severity' and how causal Bayesian networks both expose and
  resolve the problem</title>
    <summary>  An important recent preprint by Griffith et al highlights how 'collider bias'
in studies of COVID19 undermines our understanding of the disease risk and
severity. This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who
have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are
overrepresented. For example, collider bias caused by smokers being
underrepresented in the dataset may (at least partly) explain empirical results
that suggest smoking reduces the risk of COVID19. We extend the work of
Griffith et al making more explicit use of graphical causal models to interpret
observed data. We show that their smoking example can be clarified and improved
using Bayesian network models with realistic data and assumptions. We show that
there is an even more fundamental problem for risk factors like 'stress' which,
unlike smoking, is more rather than less prevalent among healthcare workers; in
this case, because of a combination of collider bias from the biased dataset
and the fact that 'healthcare worker' is a confounding variable, it is likely
that studies will wrongly conclude that stress reduces rather than increases
the risk of COVID19. Indeed, "being in close contact with COVID19 people"
reduces the risk of COVID19. To avoid such potentially erroneous conclusions,
any analysis of observational data must take account of the underlying causal
structure including colliders and confounders. If analysts fail to do this
explicitly then any conclusions they make about the effect of specific risk
factors on COVID19 are likely to be flawed.

    <title>First Principle Simulation of Coated Hydroxychloroquine on Ag, Au and Pt
  Nanoparticle as a Potential Candidate for Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)</title>
    <summary>  The {\it{in vitro}} antiviral activity of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and
chloroquine (CQ) against SARS-CoV-2 from the first month of pandemic proposed
these drugs as the appropriate therapeutic candidate, although their side
effect directed the clinical test toward optimizing the safe utilization
strategies. The noble metal nanoparticles (NP) as promising materials with
antiviral and antibacterial properties can deliver the drug to the target agent
and decrease the side effect. In this work, we have applied quantum mechanical
and classical atomistic molecular dynamics computational approaches to
demonstrate the adsorption properties of HCQ on Ag, Au, AgAu, and Pt
nanoparticles. The adsorption energies (less than -30 kcal/mole) were
established for HCQ, and the (non)perturbative effects of this drug on the
plasmonic absorption spectra of AgNP and AuNP have characterized with
time-dependent density functional theory. The effect of size and compositions
of nanoparticle on the coating with HCQ and CQ have obtained and proposed the
appropriate candidate for drug delivery. This kind of modeling could help the
experimental groups to find the efficient and safe therapies.

    <title>Generalization of the noise model for time-distance helioseismology</title>
    <summary>  In time-distance helioseismology, information about the solar interior is
encoded in measurements of travel times between pairs of points on the solar
surface. Travel times are deduced from the cross-covariance of the random wave
field. Here we consider travel times and also products of travel times as
observables. They contain information about e.g. the statistical properties of
convection in the Sun. The basic assumption of the model is that noise is the
result of the stochastic excitation of solar waves, a random process which is
stationary and Gaussian. We generalize the existing noise model (Gizon and
Birch 2004) by dropping the assumption of horizontal spatial homogeneity. Using
a recurrence relation, we calculate the noise covariance matrices for the
moments of order 4, 6, and 8 of the observed wave field, for the moments of
order 2, 3 and 4 of the cross-covariance, and for the moments of order 2, 3 and
4 of the travel times. All noise covariance matrices depend only on the
expectation value of the cross-covariance of the observed wave field. For
products of travel times, the noise covariance matrix consists of three terms
proportional to $1/T$, $1/T^2$, and $1/T^3$, where $T$ is the duration of the
observations. For typical observation times of a few hours, the term
proportional to $1/T^2$ dominates and $Cov[\tau_1 \tau_2, \tau_3 \tau_4]
\approx Cov[\tau_1, \tau_3] Cov[\tau_2, \tau_4] + Cov[\tau_1, \tau_4]
Cov[\tau_2, \tau_3]$, where the $\tau_i$ are arbitrary travel times. This
result is confirmed for $p_1$ travel times by Monte Carlo simulations and
comparisons with SDO/HMI observations. General and accurate formulae have been
derived to model the noise covariance matrix of helioseismic travel times and
products of travel times. These results could easily be generalized to other
methods of local helioseismology, such as helioseismic holography and ring
diagram analysis.

    <title>Cardiac SPECT Radiomics Features Repeatability and Reproducibility: A
  Multi Scanner Phantom Study</title>
    <summary>  Background: The aim of this study was to assess the robustness of cardiac
SPECT radiomics features against changes in imaging settings including
acquisition and reconstruction settings.
  Methods: Four scanners were used to acquire SPECT scans of a cardiac phantom
with 5mCi of 99mTc. The effects of different image acquisition and
reconstruction settings including the Number of View, View Matrix Size,
attenuation correction, image reconstruction algorithm, number of iterations,
number of subsets, type of filter, full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
Gaussian filter, Butterworth filter order, and Butterworth filter cut-off were
studied. In total 5263 different images were reconstructed. Eighty-seven
radiomic features including first, second, and high order textures were
extracted from images. To assess reproducibility and repeatability the
coefficient of variation (COV) was used for each image feature over the
different imaging settings.
  Result: IDMN and IDN features from GLCM, RP from GLRLM, ZE from GLSZM, and DE
from GLDM feature sets were the only features that were the most reproducible
(COV &lt; 5) against changes in all imaging settings. In addition, the IDMN
feature from GLCM, LALGLE, SALGLE and LGLZE from GLSZM, and SDLGLE from GLDM
feature sets were the features that were less reproducible (COV&gt;20 ) against
changes in all imaging settings. Matrix size has the greatest impact on feature
variability as most of features are not repeatable and 82.76 of them had
(COV&gt;20 ).
  Conclusion: Repeatability and reproducibility of SPECT radiomics texture
features in different imaging settings is feature-dependent, and different
image acquisitions and reconstructions have different effects on radiomics
texture features. Low COV radiomics features could be consider for further
clinical studies.

    <title>Early Screening of SARS-CoV-2 by Intelligent Analysis of X-Ray Images</title>
    <summary>  Future SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak COVID-XX might possibly occur during the
next years. However the pathology in humans is so recent that many clinical
aspects, like early detection of complications, side effects after recovery or
early screening, are currently unknown. In spite of the number of cases of
COVID-19, its rapid spread putting many sanitary systems in the edge of
collapse has hindered proper collection and analysis of the data related to
COVID-19 clinical aspects. We describe an interdisciplinary initiative that
integrates clinical research, with image diagnostics and the use of new
technologies such as artificial intelligence and radiomics with the aim of
clarifying some of SARS-CoV-2 open questions. The whole initiative addresses 3
main points: 1) collection of standardize data including images, clinical data
and analytics; 2) COVID-19 screening for its early diagnosis at primary care
centers; 3) define radiomic signatures of COVID-19 evolution and associated
pathologies for the early treatment of complications. In particular, in this
paper we present a general overview of the project, the experimental design and
first results of X-ray COVID-19 detection using a classic approach based on HoG
and feature selection. Our experiments include a comparison to some recent
methods for COVID-19 screening in X-Ray and an exploratory analysis of the
feasibility of X-Ray COVID-19 screening. Results show that classic approaches
can outperform deep-learning methods in this experimental setting, indicate the
feasibility of early COVID-19 screening and that non-COVID infiltration is the
group of patients most similar to COVID-19 in terms of radiological description
of X-ray. Therefore, an efficient COVID-19 screening should be complemented
with other clinical data to better discriminate these cases.

    <title>TREC-COVID: Constructing a Pandemic Information Retrieval Test
  Collection</title>
    <summary>  TREC-COVID is a community evaluation designed to build a test collection that
captures the information needs of biomedical researchers using the scientific
literature during a pandemic. One of the key characteristics of pandemic search
is the accelerated rate of change: the topics of interest evolve as the
pandemic progresses and the scientific literature in the area explodes. The
COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to capture this progression as it
happens. TREC-COVID, in creating a test collection around COVID-19 literature,
is building infrastructure to support new research and technologies in pandemic
search.

    <title>A Dynamical Principle For 3D-4D Interlinkage In Salpeter-like Equations</title>
    <summary>  The half-century old Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle ($MYTP$) which
provides a theoretical rationale for the covariant instantaneous approximation
($CIA$) that underlies all Salpeter-like equations, is generalized to a
covariant null-plane ansatz ($CNPA$). A common characteristic of both
formulations is an exact 3D-4D interlinkage of BS amplitudes which facilitates
a two-tier description: the 3D form for spectroscopy, and the 4D form for
transition amplitudes as 4D loop integrals. Some basic applications of $MYTP$
on the covariant null plane (quark mass function, vacuum condensates, and decay
constants) are given on the lines of earlier applications to these processes
under $CIA$.

    <title>Evasion and prediction II</title>
    <summary>  A subgroup G \leq Z^omega exhibits the Specker phenomenon if every
homomorphism G \to Z maps almost all unit vectors to 0. We give several
combinatorial characterizations of the cardinal se, the size of the smallest G
\leq Z^omega exhibiting the Specker phenomenon.
  We also prove the consistency of b &lt; e, where b is the unbounding number and
e the evasion number introduced recently by Blass. Finally we show that e \geq
\min { aleph_0--e , cov(M) }, where aleph_0--e is the aleph_0--evasion number
(the uniformity of the evasion ideal) and cov(M) is the covering number of the
meager ideal.
  All these results can be dualized. They answer several questions addressed by
Blass.

    <title>Supertropical semirings and supervaluations</title>
    <summary>  We interpret a valuation $v$ on a ring $R$ as a map $v: R \to M$ into a so
called bipotent semiring $M$ (the usual max-plus setting), and then define a
\textbf{supervaluation} $\phi$ as a suitable map into a supertropical semiring
$U$ with ghost ideal $M$ (cf. [IR1], [IR2]) covering $v$ via the ghost map $U
\to M$. The set $\Cov(v)$ of all supervaluations covering $v$ has a natural
ordering which makes it a complete lattice. In the case that $R$ is a field,
hence for $v$ a Krull valuation, we give a complete explicit description of
$\Cov(v)$.
  The theory of supertropical semirings and supervaluations aims for an algebra
fitting the needs of tropical geometry better than the usual max-plus setting.
We illustrate this by giving a supertropical version of Kapranov's lemma.

    <title>A Basic Recurrent Neural Network Model</title>
    <summary>  We present a model of a basic recurrent neural network (or bRNN) that
includes a separate linear term with a slightly "stable" fixed matrix to
guarantee bounded solutions and fast dynamic response. We formulate a state
space viewpoint and adapt the constrained optimization Lagrange Multiplier
(CLM) technique and the vector Calculus of Variations (CoV) to derive the
(stochastic) gradient descent. In this process, one avoids the commonly used
re-application of the circular chain-rule and identifies the error
back-propagation with the co-state backward dynamic equations. We assert that
this bRNN can successfully perform regression tracking of time-series.
Moreover, the "vanishing and exploding" gradients are explicitly quantified and
explained through the co-state dynamics and the update laws. The adapted CoV
framework, in addition, can correctly and principally integrate new loss
functions in the network on any variable and for varied goals, e.g., for
supervised learning on the outputs and unsupervised learning on the internal
(hidden) states.

    <title>Large continuum, oracles</title>
    <summary>  Our main theorem is about iterated forcing for making the continuum larger
than aleph_2. We present a generalization of math.LO/0303294 which is dealing
with oracles for random, etc., replacing aleph_1, aleph_2 by lambda,lambda^+
(starting with lambda=lambda^{&lt;lambda}&gt;aleph_1). Well, instead of properness we
demand absolute c.c.c. So we get, e.g. the continuum is lambda^+ but we can get
cov(meagre)=lambda. We give some applications. As in math.LO/0303294, it is a
"partial" countable support iteration but it is c.c.c.

    <title>A simple proof for the multivariate Chebyshev inequality</title>
    <summary>  In this paper a simple proof of the Chebyshev's inequality for random vectors
obtained by Chen (arXiv:0707.0805v2, 2011) is obtained. This inequality gives a
lower bound for the percentage of the population of an arbitrary random vector
X with finite mean E(X) and a positive definite covariance matrix V=Cov(X)
whose Mahalanobis distance with respect to V to the mean E(X) is less than a
fixed value. The proof is based on the calculation of the principal components.

    <title>Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle And 3D-4D Interlinkage Of
  Bethe-Salpeter Amplitudes</title>
    <summary>  This article is designed to focus attention on the Markov-Yukawa
Transversality Principle (MYTP) as a novel paradigm for an exact 3D-4D
interlinkage between the corresponding BSE amplitudes, with a closely parallel
treatment of $q{\bar q}$ and $qqq$ systems, stemming from a common 4-fermion
Lagrangian mediated by gluon (vector)-like exchange. This unique feature of
MYTP owes its origin to a Lorentz- covariant 3D support to the BS kernel, which
acts as a sort of `gauge principle' and distinguishes it from most other 3D
approaches to strong interaction dynamics. Some of the principal approaches in
the latter category are briefly reviewed so as to set the (less familiar) MYTP
in their context. Two specific types of MYTP which provide 3D support to the
BSE kernel, are considered: a) Covariant Instantaneity Ansatz (CIA); b)
Covariant LF/NP ansatz (Cov.LF). Both lead to formaly identical 3D BSE
reductions but produce sharply different 4D structures: Under CIA, the 4D loop
integrals suffer from Lorentz mismatch of the vertex functions, leading to
ill-defined time-like momentum integrals, but Cov LF is free from this disease.
This is illustrated by the pion form factor under Cov LF. The reconstruction of
the 4D $qqq$ wave function is achieved by Green's function techniques. PACS:

    <title>On shattering, splitting and reaping partitions</title>
    <summary>  In this article we investigate the dual-shattering cardinal H, the
dual-splitting cardinal S and the dual-reaping cardinal R, which are
dualizations of the well-known cardinals h (the shattering cardinal, also known
as the distributivity number of P(omega) modulo finite, s (the splitting
number) and r (the reaping number). Using some properties of the ideal J of
nowhere dual-Ramsey sets, which is an ideal over the set of partitions of
omega, we show that add(J)=cov(J)=H. With this result we can show that H &gt;
omega_1 is consistent with ZFC and as a corollary we get the relative
consistency of H &gt; t, where t is the tower number. Concerning S we show that
cov(M) is less than or equal to S (where M is the ideal of the meager sets).
For the dual-reaping cardinal R we get p is less than or equal to R, which is
less than or equal to r (where p is the pseudo-intersection number) and for a
modified dual-reaping number R' we get that R' is less than or equal to d
(where d is the dominating number). As a consistency result we get R &lt; cov(M).

    <title>The Role of Visibility in Pursuit / Evasion Games</title>
    <summary>  The cops-and-robber (CR) game has been used in mobile robotics as a
discretized model (played on a graph G) of pursuit/evasion problems. The
"classic" CR version is a perfect information game: the cops' (pursuer's)
location is always known to the robber (evader) and vice versa. Many variants
of the classic game can be defined: the robber can be invisible and also the
robber can be either adversarial (tries to avoid capture) or drunk (performs a
random walk). Furthermore, the cops and robber can reside in either nodes or
edges of G. Several of these variants are relevant as models or robotic pursuit
/ evasion. In this paper, we first define carefully several of the variants
mentioned above and related quantities such as the cop number and the capture
time. Then we introduce and study the cost of visibility (COV), a quantitative
measure of the increase in difficulty (from the cops' point of view) when the
robber is invisible. In addition to our theoretical results, we present
algorithms which can be used to compute capture times and COV of graphs which
are analytically intractable. Finally, we present the results of applying these
algorithms to the numerical computation of COV.

    <title>Covariance-domain Dictionary Learning for Overcomplete EEG Source
  Identification</title>
    <summary>  We propose an algorithm targeting the identification of more sources than
channels for electroencephalography (EEG). Our overcomplete source
identification algorithm, Cov-DL, leverages dictionary learning methods applied
in the covariance-domain. Assuming that EEG sources are uncorrelated within
moving time-windows and the scalp mixing is linear, the forward problem can be
transferred to the covariance domain which has higher dimensionality than the
original EEG channel domain. This allows for learning the overcomplete mixing
matrix that generates the scalp EEG even when there may be more sources than
sensors active at any time segment, i.e. when there are non-sparse sources.
This is contrary to straight-forward dictionary learning methods that are based
on the assumption of sparsity, which is not a satisfied condition in the case
of low-density EEG systems. We present two different learning strategies for
Cov-DL, determined by the size of the target mixing matrix. We demonstrate that
Cov-DL outperforms existing overcomplete ICA algorithms under various scenarios
of EEG simulations and real EEG experiments.

    <title>Spin Canting and Orbital Order in Spinel Vanadate Thin Films</title>
    <summary>  We report on the epitaxial film growth and characterization of CoV$_2$O$_4$,
a near-itinerant spinel vanadate, grown on (001) SrTiO$_3$. The symmetry
lowering of the unit cell from cubic in the bulk to orthorhombic in the films
results in dramatic differences in the magnetic anisotropy compared to bulk, as
determined from structural and magnetic characterization. Bulk cubic
CoV$_2$O$_4$ has been found to defy predictions by showing orbital degeneracy
seemingly lasting to very low temperatures, with only small anomalies in
magnetization and neutron experiments signaling a possible spin/orbital glass
transition at T = 90 K. In epitaxial thin films presented in this paper,
structurally tuning the CoV$_2$O$_4$ away from cubic symmetry leads to a
completely different low temperature non-collinear ground state. Via
magnetization and neutron scattering measurements we show that the 90 K
transition is associated with a major spin reorientation away from the
ferrimagnetic easy axis [001] to the [110] direction. Furthermore, the V-spins
cant away from this direction with extracted perpendicular moments providing
evidence of a larger canting angle compared to bulk. This result indicates that
compressive strain pushes the system deeper into the insulating state, i.e.,
away from the localized - itinerant crossover regime.

    <title>Clumsy packings of graphs</title>
    <summary>  Let $G$ and $H$ be graphs. We say that $P$ is an $H$-packing of $G$ if $P$ is
a set of edge-disjoint copies of $H$ in $G$. An $H$-packing $P$ is maximal if
there is no other $H$-packing of $G$ that properly contains $P$. Packings of
maximum cardinality have been studied intensively, with several recent
breakthrough results. Here, we consider minimum cardinality maximal packings.
An $H$-packing $P$ is clumsy if it is maximal of minimum size. Let $cl(G,H)$ be
the size of a clumsy $H$-packing of $G$. We provide nontrivial bounds for
$cl(G,H)$, and in many cases asymptotically determine $cl(G,H)$ for some
generic classes of graphs $G$ such as $K_n$ (the complete graph), $Q_n$ (the
cube graph), as well as square, triangular, and hexagonal grids. We
asymptotically determine $cl(K_n,H)$ for every fixed non-empty graph $H$. In
particular, we prove that $$ cl(K_n, H) = \frac{\binom{n}{2}-
ex(n,H)}{|E(H)|}+o(ex(n,H)),$$ where $ex(n,H)$ is the extremal number of $H$. A
related natural parameter is $cov(G,H)$, that is the smallest number of copies
of $H$ in $G$ (not necessarily edge-disjoint) whose removal from $G$ results in
an $H$-free graph. While clearly $cov(G,H) \le cl(G,H)$, all of our lower
bounds for $cl(G,H)$ apply to $cov(G,H)$ as well.

    <title>Demand forecasting in supply chain: The impact of demand volatility in
  the presence of promotion</title>
    <summary>  The demand for a particular product or service is typically associated with
different uncertainties that can make them volatile and challenging to predict.
Demand unpredictability is one of the managers' concerns in the supply chain
that can cause large forecasting errors, issues in the upstream supply chain
and impose unnecessary costs. We investigate 843 real demand time series with
different values of coefficient of variations (CoV) where promotion causes
volatility over the entire demand series. In such a case, forecasting demand
for different CoV require different models to capture the underlying behavior
of demand series and pose significant challenges due to very different and
diverse demand behavior. We decompose demand into baseline and promotional
demand and propose a hybrid model to forecast demand. Our results indicate that
our proposed hybrid model generates robust and accurate forecast across series
with different levels of volatilities. We stress the necessity of decomposition
for volatile demand series. We also model demand series with a number of well
known statistical and machine learning (ML) models to investigate their
performance empirically. We found that ARIMA with covariate (ARIMAX) works well
to forecast volatile demand series, but exponential smoothing with covariate
(ETSX) has a poor performance. Support vector regression (SVR) and dynamic
linear regression (DLR) models generate robust forecasts across different
categories of demands with different CoV values.

    <title>A Semantically Enriched Dataset based on Biomedical NER for the COVID19
  Open Research Dataset Challenge</title>
    <summary>  Research into COVID-19 is a big challenge and highly relevant at the moment.
New tools are required to assist medical experts in their research with
relevant and valuable information. The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge
(CORD-19) is a "call to action" for computer scientists to develop these
innovative tools. Many of these applications are empowered by entity
information, i. e. knowing which entities are used within a sentence. For this
paper, we have developed a pipeline upon the latest Named Entity Recognition
tools for Chemicals, Diseases, Genes and Species. We apply our pipeline to the
COVID-19 research challenge and share the resulting entity mentions with the
community.

    <title>Accounting for Uncertainty During a Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  We discuss several issues of statistical design, data collection, analysis,
communication, and decision making that have arisen in recent and ongoing
coronavirus studies, focusing on tools for assessment and propagation of
uncertainty. This paper does not purport to be a comprehensive survey of the
research literature; rather, we use examples to illustrate statistical points
that we think are important.

    <title>COVID-19: Strategies for Allocation of Test Kits</title>
    <summary>  With the increasing spread of COVID-19, it is important to systematically
test more and more people. The current strategy for test-kit allocation is
mostly rule-based, focusing on individuals having (a) symptoms for COVID-19,
(b) travel history or (c) contact history with confirmed COVID-19 patients.
Such testing strategy may miss out on detecting asymptomatic individuals who
got infected via community spread. Thus, it is important to allocate a separate
budget of test-kits per day targeted towards preventing community spread and
detecting new cases early on.
  In this report, we consider the problem of allocating test-kits and discuss
some solution approaches. We believe that these approaches will be useful to
contain community spread and detect new cases early on. Additionally, these
approaches would help in collecting unbiased data which can then be used to
improve the accuracy of machine learning models trained to predict COVID-19
infections.

    <title>How much did the Tourism Industry Lost? Estimating Earning Loss of
  Tourism in the Philippines</title>
    <summary>  The study aimed to forecast the total earnings lost of the tourism industry
of the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic using seasonal autoregressive
integrated moving average. Several models were considered based on the
autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation graphs. Based on the Akaike's
Information Criterion (AIC) and Root Mean Squared Error,
ARIMA(1,1,1)$\times$(1,0,1)$_{12}$ was identified to be the better model among
the others with an AIC value of $-414.51$ and RMSE of $47884.85$. Moreover, it
is expected that the industry will have an estimated earning loss of around
170.5 billion pesos if the COVID-19 crisis will continue up to July. Possible
recommendations to mitigate the problem includes stopping foreign tourism but
allowing regions for domestic travels if the regions are confirmed to have no
cases of COVID-19, assuming that every regions will follow the stringent
guidelines to eliminate or prevent transmissions; or extending this to
countries with no COVID-19 cases.

    <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Global Health Decisions</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of in-silico
epidemiological modelling in predicting the dynamics of infectious diseases to
inform health policy and decision makers about suitable prevention and
containment strategies. Work in this setting involves solving challenging
inference and control problems in individual-based models of ever increasing
complexity. Here we discuss recent breakthroughs in machine learning,
specifically in simulation-based inference, and explore its potential as a
novel venue for model calibration to support the design and evaluation of
public health interventions. To further stimulate research, we are developing
software interfaces that turn two cornerstone COVID-19 and malaria epidemiology
models COVID-sim, (https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/) and OpenMalaria
(https://github.com/SwissTPH/openmalaria) into probabilistic programs, enabling
efficient interpretable Bayesian inference within those simulators.

    <title>Spin-orbit transitions in $α$ and $γ$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$</title>
    <summary>  $\gamma$-triclinic and $\alpha$-monoclinic polymorphs of CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ are
two of the few known transition metal ion based materials that display stepped
$1/3$ magnetization plateaus at low temperatures. Neutron diffraction [M.
Markkula et al. Phys. Rev. B 86, 134401 (2012)], x-ray dichroism [N. Hollmann
et al. Phys. Rev. B 89, 201101(R) (2014)], and dielectric measurements [K.
Singh et al. J. Mater. Chem. 22, 6436 (2012)] have shown a coupling between
orbital, magnetic and structural orders in CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$. We apply neutron
inelastic scattering to investigate this coupling by measuring the spin-orbit
transitions in both $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ polymorphs. We find the spin-exchange
and anisotropy in monoclinic $\alpha$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ to be weak in comparison
with the spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$ and estimate an upper limit of
$|J/\lambda| \sim$ 0.05. However, the spin exchange is larger in the triclinic
polymorph and we suggest the excitations are predominately two dimensional. The
local compression of the octahedra surrounding the Co$^{2+}$ ion results in a
direct coupling between higher energy orbital levels, the magnetic ground
state, and elastic strain. CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ is therefore an example where the
local distortion along with the spin-orbit coupling provides a means of
intertwining structural and magnetic properties. We finish the paper by
investigating the low-energy magnetic fluctuations within the ground state
doublet and report a magnetic excitation that is independent of the local
crystalline electric field. We characterize the temperature and momentum
dependence of these excitations and discuss possible connections to the
magnetization plateaus.

    <title>Avoiding COVID-19: Aerosol Guidelines</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need to understand
respiratory virus transmission mechanisms. In preparation for an anticipated
influenza pandemic, a substantial body of literature has developed over the
last few decades showing that the short-range aerosol route is an important,
though often neglected transmission path. We develop a simple mathematical
model for COVID-19 transmission via aerosols, apply it to known outbreaks, and
present quantitative guidelines for ventilation and occupancy in the workplace.

    <title>Further cardinal arithmetic</title>
    <summary>  We continue the investigations in the author's book on cardinal arithmetic,
assuming some knowledge of it. We deal with the cofinality of (S_{&lt;=
aleph_0}(kappa), subseteq) for kappa real valued measurable (Section 3),
densities of box products (Section 5,3), prove the equality cov(lambda, lambda,
theta^+,2)=pp(lambda) in more cases even when cf(lambda)= aleph_0 (Section 1),
deal with bounds of pp(lambda) for lambda limit of inaccessible (Section 4) and
give proofs to various claims I was sure I had already written but did not find
(Section 6).

    <title>Upper bound of a volume exponent for directed polymers in a random
  environment</title>
    <summary>  We consider the model of directed polymers in a random environment introduced
by Petermann : the random walk is $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued and has independent
gaussian $N(0,I_d)$-increments, and the random media is a stationary centred
Gaussian process $(g(k,x), k \geq 1, x \in \mathbb{R}^d)$ with covariance
matrix $cov(g(i,x),g(j,y))=\delta_{ij} \Gamma(x-y) ,$ where $\Gamma$ is a
bounded integrable function on $\mathbb{R}^d .$ For this model, we establish an
upper bound of the volume exponent in all dimensions $d$.

    <title>Antichains in partially ordered sets of singular cofinality</title>
    <summary>  In their paper from 1981, Milner and Sauer conjectured that for any poset P,
if cf(P)=lambda&gt;cf(lambda)=kappa, then P must contain an antichain of size
kappa. We prove that for lambda&gt;cf(lambda)=kappa, if there exists a cardinal
mu&lt;lambda such that cov(lambda,mu,kappa,2)=lambda, then any poset of cofinality
lambda contains lambda^kappa antichains of size kappa. The hypothesis of our
theorem is very weak and is a consequence of many well-known axioms such as
GCH, SSH and PFA. The consistency of the negation of this hypothesis is
unknown.

    <title>On the ideal $(v^0)$</title>
    <summary>  The $\sigma$-ideal $(v^0)$ is associated with the Silver forcing, see
\cite{bre}. Also, it constitutes the family of all completely doughnut null
sets, see \cite{hal}. We introduce segments and $*$-segments topologies, to
state some resemblances of $(v^0)$ to the family of Ramsey null sets. To
describe $add(v^0)$ we adopt a proof of Base Matrix Lemma. Consistent results
are stated, too. Halbeisen's conjecture $cov(v^0) = add(v^0)$ is confirmed
under the hypothesis $t= \min \{\cf (\frak c), r\} $. The hypothesis
$h=\omega_1$ implies that $(v^0)$ has the ideal type $(\frak c, \omega_1,\frak
c)$.

    <title>Antithetic variates in higher dimensions</title>
    <summary>  We introduce the concept of multidimensional antithetic as the absolute
minimum of the covariance defined on the orthogonal group by $A\mapsto
Cov(f(\xi),f(A\xi))$ where $\xi$ is a standard $N$-dimensional normal random
variable and $f:\mathbb{R}^{N}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an almost everywhere
differentiable function. The antithetic matrix is designed to optimise the
calculation of $E[f(\xi)]$ in a Monte Carlo simulation. We present an iterative
annealing algorithm that dynamically incorporates the estimation of the
antithetic matrix within the Monte Carlo calculation.

    <title>Exercices de style: a homotopy theory for set theory, I</title>
    <summary>  We construct a model category (in the sense of Quillen) for set theory,
starting from two arbitrary, but natural, conventions. It is the simplest
category satisfying our conventions and modelling the notions of finiteness,
countability and infinite equi-cardinality. In a subsequent paper \cite{GaHa1}
we give a homotopy theoretic dictionary of set theoretic concepts, most notably
Shelah's covering number $\cov(\lambda, \aleph_1,\aleph_1,2)$, recovered from
this model category.
  We argue that from the homotopy theoretic point of view our construction is
essentially automatic following basic existing methods, and so is (almost all)
the verification that the construction works.

    <title>Kernelized Covariance for Action Recognition</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we aim at increasing the descriptive power of the covariance
matrix, limited in capturing linear mutual dependencies between variables only.
We present a rigorous and principled mathematical pipeline to recover the
kernel trick for computing the covariance matrix, enhancing it to model more
complex, non-linear relationships conveyed by the raw data. To this end, we
propose Kernelized-COV, which generalizes the original covariance
representation without compromising the efficiency of the computation. In the
experiments, we validate the proposed framework against many previous
approaches in the literature, scoring on par or superior with respect to the
state of the art on benchmark datasets for 3D action recognition.

    <title>Waring decompositions and identifiability via Bertini and Macaulay2
  software</title>
    <summary>  Starting from our previous papers [AGMO] and [ABC], we prove the existence of
a non-empty Euclidean open subset whose elements are polynomial vectors with 4
components, in 3 variables, degrees, respectively, 2,3,3,3 and rank 6, which
are not identifiable over $ \mathbb{C} $ but are identifiable over $ \mathbb{R}
$. This result has been obtained via computer-aided procedures suitably adapted
to investigate the number of Waring decompositions for general polynomial
vectors over the fields of complex and real numbers. Furthermore, by means of
the Hessian criterion ([COV]), we prove identifiability over $ \mathbb{C} $ for
polynomial vectors in many cases of sub-generic rank.

    <title>The higher Cichon diagram in the degenerate case</title>
    <summary>  For a regular uncountable cardinal kappa, we discuss the order relationship
between the unbounding and dominating numbers on kappa and cardinal invariants
of the higher meager ideal M_kappa. In particular, we obtain a complete
characterization of add(M_kappa) and cof(M_kappa) in terms of cov(M_kappa) and
non(M_kappa) and unbounding and dominating numbers, and we provide models
showing that there are no restrictions on the value of non(M_kappa) in the
degenerate case 2^{&lt;kappa} &gt; kappa except 2^{&lt;kappa} leq non(M_kappa) leq
2^kappa. The corresponding question for cof(M_kappa) remains open. Our results
answer questions of joint work of the author with Brooke-Taylor, Friedman, and
Montoya.

    <title>Observed mobility behavior data reveal social distancing inertia</title>
    <summary>  The research team has utilized an integrated dataset, consisting of
anonymized location data, COVID-19 case data, and census population
information, to study the impact of COVID-19 on human mobility. The study
revealed that statistics related to social distancing, namely trip rate, miles
traveled per person, and percentage of population staying at home have all
showed an unexpected trend, which we named social distancing inertia. The
trends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics
started improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a
portion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing
voluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However,
after about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite
the continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a
natural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the
extent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national
data showed that the inertia phenomenon is universal, happening in all the U.S.
states and for all the studied statistics. The U.S. states showed a
synchronized trend, regardless of the timeline of their statewide COVID-19 case
spreads or government orders.

We numerically calculate the full covariance matrices Cov of two-point
statistics of cosmic shear, based on the expressions derived in the first paper
of this series. The individual terms are compared for two survey geometries
with large and small cosmic variance. We use analyses based on maximum
likelihood of Cov and the Fisher information matrix in order to derive expected
constraints on cosmological parameters. As an illustrative example, we simulate
various survey geometries consisting of 300 individual fields of 13'x13' size,
placed (semi-)randomly into patches which are assumed to be widely separated on
the sky and therefore uncorrelated. Using the aperture mass statistics, the
optimum survey consists of 10 patches with 30 images in each patch. If
\Omega_m, \sigma_8 and \Gamma are supposed to be extracted from the data, the
minimum variance bounds on these three parameters are 0.17, 0.25 and 0.04
respectively. These variances raise slightly when the initial power spectrum
index n_s is also to be determined from the data. The cosmological constant is
only poorly constrained.

    <title>Alternating groups and moduli space lifting Invariants</title>
    <summary>  Main Theorem: Spaces of r-branch point 3-cycle covers, degree n or Galois of
degree n!/2 have one (resp. two) component(s) if r=n-1 (resp. r\ge n). Improves
Fried-Serre on deciding when sphere covers with odd-order branching lift to
unramified Spin covers. We produce Hurwitz-Torelli automorphic functions on
Hurwitz spaces, and draw Inverse Galois conclusions. Example: Absolute spaces
of 3-cycle covers with +1 (resp. -1) lift invariant carry canonical even (resp.
odd) theta functions when r is even (resp. odd). For inner spaces the result is
independent of r. Another use appears in,
http://www.math.uci.edu/~mfried/paplist-mt/twoorbit.html, "Connectedness of
families of sphere covers of A_n-Type." This shows the M(odular) T(ower)s for
the prime p=2 lying over Hurwitz spaces first studied by,
http://www.math.uci.edu/~mfried/othlist-cov/hurwitzLiu-Oss.pdf, Liu and
Osserman have 2-cusps. That is sufficient to establish the Main Conjecture: (*)
High tower levels are general-type varieties and have no rational points.For
infinitely many of those MTs, the tree of cusps contains a subtree -- a spire
-- isomorphic to the tree of cusps on a modular curve tower. This makes
plausible a version of Serre's O(pen) I(mage) T(heorem) on such MTs.
Establishing these modular curve-like properties opens, to MTs, modular
curve-like thinking where modular curves have never gone before. A fuller html

    <title>Functional Principal Components Analysis of Spatially Correlated Data</title>
    <summary>  This paper focuses on the analysis of spatially correlated functional data.
The between-curve correlation is modeled by correlating functional principal
component scores of the functional data. We propose a Spatial Principal
Analysis by Conditional Expectation framework to explicitly estimate spatial
correlations and reconstruct individual curves. This approach works even when
the observed data per curve are sparse. Assuming spatial stationarity,
empirical spatial correlations are calculated as the ratio of eigenvalues of
the smoothed covariance surface $Cov(X_i(s),X_i(t))$ and cross-covariance
surface $Cov(X_i(s), X_j(t))$ at locations indexed by $i$ and $j$. Then a
anisotropy Mat\'ern spatial correlation model is fit to empirical correlations.
Finally, principal component scores are estimated to reconstruct the sparsely
observed curves. This framework can naturally accommodate arbitrary covariance
structures, but there is an enormous reduction in computation if one can assume
the separability of temporal and spatial components. We propose hypothesis
tests to examine the separability as well as the isotropy effect of spatial
correlation. Simulation studies and applications of empirical data show
improvements in the curve reconstruction using our framework over the method
where curves are assumed to be independent. In addition, we show that the
asymptotic properties of estimates in uncorrelated case still hold in our case
if 'mild' spatial correlation is assumed.

    <title>The closed Steinhaus properties of $σ$-ideals on topological groups</title>
    <summary>  We prove that any meager quasi-analytic subgroup of a topological group $G$
belongs to every $\sigma$-ideal $\mathcal I$ on $G$ possessing the closed $\pm
n$-Steinhaus property for some $n\in\mathbb N$. An ideal $\mathcal I$ on a
topological group $G$ is defined to have the closed $\pm n$-Steinhaus property
if for any closed subsets $A_1,\dots,A_n\notin\mathcal I$ of $G$ the product
$(A_1\cup A_1^{-1})\cdots (A_n\cup A_n^{-1})$ is not nowhere dense in $G$.
Since the $\sigma$-ideal $\mathcal E$ generated by closed Haar null sets in a
locally compact group $G$ has the closed $\pm 2$-Steinhaus property, we
conclude that each meager quasi-analytic subgroup $H\subset G$ belongs to the
ideal $\mathcal E$. For analytic subgroups of the real line this result was
proved by Laczkovich in 1998. We shall discuss possible generalizations of the
Laczkovich Theorem to non-locally compact groups and construct an example of a
meager Borel subgroup in $\mathbb Z^\omega$ which cannot be covered by
countably many closed Haar-null (or even closed Haar-meager) sets. On the other
hand, assuming that $cof(\mathcal M)=cov(\mathcal M)=cov(\mathcal N)$ we
construct a subgroup $H\subset 2^\omega$ which is meager and Haar null but does
not belong to the $\sigma$-ideal $\mathcal E$. The construction uses a new
cardinal characteristic $voc^*(\mathcal I,\mathcal J)$ which seems to be
interesting by its own.

    <title>Retweeting for COVID-19: Consensus building, information sharing,
  dissent, and lockdown life</title>
    <summary>  Purpose: Public attitudes towards COVID-19 and social distancing are critical
in reducing its spread. It is therefore important to understand public
reactions, information dissemination and consensus building in all major forms,
including social media. This article investigates important issues reflected on
Twitter. Design/methodology/approach: A thematic analysis of the most retweeted
English-language tweets on Twitter mentioning COVID-19 during March 10-29,
2020. Findings: The main themes identified for the 87 qualifying tweets
accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life; attitude towards social
restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with COVID-19; support for key
workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. Research limitations/implications:
Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial tweets. Users
shared social distancing information, helped build support for social
distancing, criticised government responses, expressed support for key workers,
and helped each other to cope with social isolation. A few popular tweets not
supporting social distancing show that government messages sometimes failed.
Practical implications: Public health campaigns in future may consider
encouraging grass roots social web activity to support campaign goals. At a
methodological level, analysing retweet counts emphasised politics and ignored
practical implementation issues. Originality/value: This is the first
qualitative analysis of general COVID-19-related retweeting.

    <title>Group Testing for COVID-19: How to Stop Worrying and Test More</title>
    <summary>  The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel corona virus has
an exponential rate of infection. COVID-19 is particularly notorious as the
onset of symptoms in infected patients are usually delayed and there exists a
large number of asymptomatic carriers. In order to prevent overwhelming of
medical facilities and large fatality rate, early stage testing and diagnosis
are key requirements. In this article, we discuss the methodologies from the
group testing literature and its relevance to COVID-19 diagnosis. Specifically,
we investigate the efficiency of group testing using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) for COVID-19. Group testing is a method in which multiple samples are
pooled together in groups and fewer tests are performed on these groups to
discern all the infected samples. We study the effect of dilution due to
pooling in group testing and show that group tests can perform well even in the
presence of dilution effects. We present multiple group testing algorithms that
could reduce the number of tests performed for COVID-19 diagnosis. We analyze
the efficiency of these tests and provide insights on their practical
relevance. With the use of algorithms described here, test plans can be
developed that can enable testing centers to increase the number of diagnosis
performed without increasing the number of PCR tests. The codes for generating
test plans are available online at [1].

    <title>Flattening the Curve: Insights From Queueing Theory</title>
    <summary>  The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus was first identified in 2019 in
Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently
spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and
citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States
healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm
the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and
states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social
distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the
curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people
hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given
that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we
model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the
theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates.
With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the
peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how
aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the
capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve
impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time
of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical
evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the
insights from the model.

    <title>SARS-CoV-2 mortality in blacks and temperature-sensitivity to an
  angiotensin-2 receptor blocker</title>
    <summary>  Tropical climates provoke adaptations in skin pigmentation and in mechanisms
controlling the volume, salt-content and pressure of body fluids. For many
whose distant ancestors moved to temperate climes, these adaptations proved
harmful: pigmentation decreased by natural selection and susceptibility to
hypertension emerged. Now an added risk is lung inflammation from coronavirus
that may be furthered by innate immune differences. Hypertension and
coronavirus have in common angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which
decreases blood pressure and mediates virus entry. In keeping with less
detailed studies, a long-term case-report shows that decreased blood pressure
induced by blocking a primary angiotensin receptor is supplemented, above
critical blocker dosage, by a further temperature-dependent fall, likely
mediated by ACE2 and secondary angiotensin receptors. Temperature-dependence
suggests a linkage with tropical heritage and an influence of blockers on the
progress of coronavirus infections. Positive therapeutic results should result
from negation of host pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the primary
angiotensin receptor and concomitant promotion of countervailing
anti-inflammatory effects mediated by ACE2 through other receptors. These
effects may involve components of the lectin complement pathway. Black
vulnerability, more likely based on physiological than on socioeconomic
differences, provides an important clue that may guide treatments.

    <title>Aggregated Private Information Retrieval: A First Practical
  Implementation to Support Large-Scale Disease Analytics</title>
    <summary>  With the outbreak of the coronavirus, governments rely more and more on
location data shared by European mobile network operators to monitor the
advancements of the disease. In order to comply with often strict privacy
requirements, this location data, however, has to be anonymized, limiting its
usefulness for making statements about a filtered part of the population, like
already infected people. In this research, we aim to assist with the disease
tracking efforts by designing a protocol to detect coronavirus hotspots from
mobile data while still maintaining compliance with privacy expectations. We
use various state-of-the-art privacy-preserving cryptographic primitives to
design a protocol that can best be described as aggregated private information
retrieval (APIR). Our protocol is based on homomorphic encryption, with
additional measures to protect against malicious requests from clients. We have
implemented our APIR protocol in the SEAL library and tested it for parameters
suitable to create a coronavirus hotspot map for entire nationstates. This
demonstrates that it is feasible to apply our APIR protocol to support
nationwide disease analysis while still preserve the privacy of infected
people.

    <title>Modelling death rates due to COVID-19: A Bayesian approach</title>
    <summary>  Objective: To estimate the number of deaths in Peru due to COVID-19. Design:
With a priori information obtained from the daily number of deaths due to
CODIV-19 in China and data from the Peruvian authorities, we constructed a
predictive Bayesian non-linear model for the number of deaths in Peru.
Exposure: COVID-19. Outcome: Number of deaths. Results: Assuming an
intervention level similar to the one implemented in China, the total number of
deaths in Peru is expected to be 612 (95%CI: 604.3 - 833.7) persons. Sixty four
days after the first reported death, the 99% of expected deaths will be
observed. The inflexion point in the number of deaths is estimated to be around
day 26 (95%CI: 25.1 - 26.8) after the first reported death. Conclusion: These
estimates can help authorities to monitor the epidemic and implement strategies
in order to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>PACT: Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact
  Tracing</title>
    <summary>  The global health threat from COVID-19 has been controlled in a number of
instances by large-scale testing and contact tracing efforts. We created this
document to suggest three functionalities on how we might best harness
computing technologies to supporting the goals of public health organizations
in minimizing morbidity and mortality associated with the spread of COVID-19,
while protecting the civil liberties of individuals. In particular, this work
advocates for a third-party free approach to assisted mobile contact tracing,
because such an approach mitigates the security and privacy risks of requiring
a trusted third party. We also explicitly consider the inferential risks
involved in any contract tracing system, where any alert to a user could itself
give rise to de-anonymizing information.
  More generally, we hope to participate in bringing together colleagues in
industry, academia, and civil society to discuss and converge on ideas around a
critical issue rising with attempts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Sewage Pooling Test for SARS-CoV-2</title>
    <summary>  CoVID-19 is currently one of the biggest threats to mankind. To date, it is
the reason for infections of over 35 lakhs and the death of over 2 lakh human
beings. We propose a procedure to detect CoVID-19 affected localities using a
sewage mass testing and pooling mechanism which has gained ground in recent
times. The proposed method named Sewage Pooling Algorithm tests wastewater
samples from sewage systems to pinpoint the regions which are affected by
maximum chances of the virus spread. The algorithm also uses a priority-based
backtracking procedure to perform testing in sewage links depending on the
probability of infection in the sub-areas. For places with very rare CoVID
cases, we present a gradient-based search method to prune those areas. The
proposed method has less human intervention and increases the effective
tests/million people over current in-place methods.

    <title>Modeling the Control of COVID-19: Impact of Policy Interventions and
  Meteorological Factors</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a dynamical model to describe the transmission of
COVID-19, which is spreading in China and many other countries. To avoid a
larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of
strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine
is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to
estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into
seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and
officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model
is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the
transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend
of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role
in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The
control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and
discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is
in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human
transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may
become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease
is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the
virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index
is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high
and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail
vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the
effectiveness of efficient vaccination. Once the vaccine comes into use, the
numerical simulation provide a promptly prospective research.

    <title>The test-negative design with additional population controls: a
  practical approach to rapidly obtain information on the causes of the
  SARS-CoV-2 epidemic</title>
    <summary>  Testing of symptomatic persons for infection with SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly
used in different countries. To collect information to understand the causes of
the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose two types of case-control studies that can be
carried out jointly in test-settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the
test-negative case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only
demands collecting information about potential risk factors for COVID-19 from
the tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies (CC)
with population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more
population controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so
that test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population
controls. We first summarize the TND and explain how to add it to large-scale
testing of symptomatic persons. The TND will detect differences in risk factors
between symptomatic persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who
have other respiratory infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with
effect sizes of equal magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory
infections will not be identified by the TND. Second, we discuss how to add
population controls to compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives
separately, yielding two additional case-control studies. We describe two
different types of population control groups: one composed of accompanying
persons to the test facilities, the other drawn from existing country-wide
health care databases. We also describe other types of population controls that
may be most suitable in other situations. Combining the test-negative design
with population controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes
between exposures that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory
infections, and exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19.

    <title>Variability modes in core flows inverted from geomagnetic field models</title>
    <summary>  The flow of liquid metal inside the Earth's core produces the geomagnetic
field and its time variations. Understanding the variability of those deep
currents is crucial to improve the forecast of geomagnetic field variations,
which affect human spacial and aeronautic activities. Moreover, it may provide
relevant information on the core dynamics. The main goal of this study is to
extract and characterize the leading variability modes of core flows over
centennial periods, and to assess their statistical robustness. To this end, we
use flows that we invert from two geomagnetic field models (gufm1 and COV-OBS),
and apply Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition of
coupled fields. The quasi geostrophic (QG) flows inverted from both geomagnetic
field models show similar features. However, COV-OBS has a less energetic mean
and larger time variability. The statistical significance of flow components is
tested from analyses performed on subareas of the whole domain. Bootstrapping
methods are also used to extract significant flow features required by both
gufm1 and COV-OBS. Three main empirical circulation modes emerge,
simultaneously constrained by both geomagnetic field models and expected to be
robust against the particular a priori used to build them (large scale QG
dynamics). Mode 1 exhibits three large vortices at medium/high latitudes, with
opposite circulation under the Atlantic and the Pacific hemispheres. Mode 2
interestingly accounts for most of the variations of the Earth's core angular
momentum. In this mode, the regions close to the tangent cylinder and to the
equator are correlated, and oscillate with a period between 80 and 90 years.
Each of these two modes is energetic enough to alter the mean flow, sometimes
reinforcing the eccentric gyre, and other times breaking it up into smaller
circulations. The three main circulation modes added together to the mean flow
account for about 70% of the flows variability, 90% of the root mean square
total velocities, and 95% of the secular variation induced by the total flows.
Direct physical interpretation of the computed modes is not straightforward.
Nonethe-less, similarities found between the two first modes and time/spatial
features identified in different studies of core dynamics, suggest that our
approach can help to pinpoint the relevant physical processes inside the core
on centennial timescales.

    <title>The HEV Ventilator Proposal</title>
    <summary>  We propose the design of a ventilator which can be easily manufactured and
integrated into the hospital environment to support COVID-19 patients. The unit
is designed to support standard ventilator modes of operation, most importantly
PRVC (Pressure Regulated Volume Control) and SIMV-PC (Synchronised Intermittent
Mandatory Ventilation) modes. The unit is not yet an approved medical device
and is in the concept and prototyping stage. It is presented here to invite
fast feedback for development and deployment in the face of the COVID-19
pandemic.

    <title>CoVista: A Unified View on Privacy Sensitive Mobile Contact Tracing
  Effort</title>
    <summary>  Governments around the world have become increasingly frustrated with tech
giants dictating public health policy. The software created by Apple and Google
enables individuals to track their own potential exposure through collated
exposure notifications. However, the same software prohibits location tracking,
denying key information needed by public health officials for robust contract
tracing. This information is needed to treat and isolate COVID-19 positive
people, identify transmission hotspots, and protect against continued spread of
infection. In this article, we present two simple ideas: the lighthouse and the
covid-commons that address the needs of public health authorities while
preserving the privacy-sensitive goals of the Apple and google exposure
notification protocols.

    <title>Method of Linear Invariants for description of beam dynamics of FEL
  undulator</title>
    <summary>  We propose a new model for description of electrons beam dynamics in Free
Electron Laser (FEL) undulator, based on the method of linear time-dependent
invariants of quantum-mechanical charge particle. The magnetic field has
periodic structure along the undulator. For this problem, described by
time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian, we obtain exact solution. The
time-evolutions of the tree quantum fluctuations: covariance cov(q,p), var(q)
and var(p) for the charge particle in this case are also determined. This
research will help to optimize the FEL undulator: for example, using a 2.5 GeV
linear electron accelerator it will be possible to emit radiation at 1.5 nm and
shorter length.
  This method could be applicable also to any device with periodic structure of
applied field (e.g. Tokamak, cyclic accelerators) for the case of charge
non-relativistic quantum particles.

    <title>Relating two genus 0 problems of John Thompson</title>
    <summary>  The "relating" entwines three problems:
  1. Davenport's Problem, describing pairs of polynomials over Q whose ranges
on Z/p are the same for almost all p.
  2. Showing that the monodromy groups of rational function maps over the
complexes are limited to a finite set of groups, outside of groups close to
alternating groups (example, symmetric groups) with special representations,
and dihedral and cyclic groups.
  3. Relating the genus 0 modular curves to the character group of the Monster
simple group, so-called Monstrous Moonshine.

    <title>Can the Adaptive Metropolis Algorithm Collapse Without the Covariance
  Lower Bound?</title>
    <summary>  The Adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm is based on the symmetric random-walk
Metropolis algorithm. The proposal distribution has the following
time-dependent covariance matrix at step $n+1$ \[
  S_n = Cov(X_1,...,X_n) + \epsilon I, \] that is, the sample covariance matrix
of the history of the chain plus a (small) constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ multiple of
the identity matrix $I$. The lower bound on the eigenvalues of $S_n$ induced by
the factor $\epsilon I$ is theoretically convenient, but practically
cumbersome, as a good value for the parameter $\epsilon$ may not always be easy
to choose. This article considers variants of the AM algorithm that do not
explicitly bound the eigenvalues of $S_n$ away from zero. The behaviour of
$S_n$ is studied in detail, indicating that the eigenvalues of $S_n$ do not
tend to collapse to zero in general.

    <title>Linear regression estimation in non-linear single index models</title>
    <summary>  In this article, we consider the problem of estimating the index parameter
$\alpha_0$ in the single index model $E[Y |X] = f_0(\alpha_0^T X)$ with $f_0$
the unknown ridge function defined on $\mathbb{R}$, $X$ a d-dimensional
covariate and $Y$ the response. We show that when $X$ is Gaussian, then
$\alpha_0$ can be consistently estimated by regressing the observed responses
$Y_i$, $i = 1, . . ., n$ on the covariates $X_1, . . ., X_n$ after centering
and rescaling. The method works without any additional smoothness assumptions
on $f_0$ and only requires that $cov(f_0(\alpha_0^T X),\alpha_0^TX) \neq 0$,
which is always satisfied by monotone and non-constant functions $f_0$. We show
that our estimator is asymptotically normal and give the expression with its
asymptotic variance. The approach is illustrated through a simulation study.

    <title>Uncertainty Analysis of Melting and Resolidification of Gold Film
  Irradiated by Nano- to Femtosecond Lasers Using Stochastic Method</title>
    <summary>  A sample-based stochastic model is presented to investigate the effects of
uncertainties of various input parameters, including laser fluence, laser pulse
duration, thermal conductivity constants for electron, and electron-lattice
coupling factor, on solid-liquid phase change of gold film under nano- to
femtosecond laser irradiation. Rapid melting and resolidification of a free
standing gold film subject to nano- to femtosecond laser are simulated using a
two-temperature model incorporated with the interfacial tracking method. The
interfacial velocity and temperature are obtained by solving the energy
equation in terms of volumetric enthalpy for control volume. The convergence of
variance (COV) is used to characterize the variability of the input parameters,
and the interquartile range (IQR) is used to calculate the uncertainty of the
output parameters. The IQR analysis shows that the laser fluence and the
electron-lattice coupling factor have the strongest influences on the
interfacial location, velocity, and temperatures.

    <title>Elaborating Inductive Definitions and Course-of-Values Induction in
  Cedille</title>
    <summary>  In the Calculus of Dependent Lambda Eliminations (CDLE), a pure Curry-style
type theory, it is possible to generically {\lambda}-encode inductive datatypes
which support course-of-values (CoV) induction. We present a datatype subsystem
for Cedille (an implementation of CDLE) that provides this feature to
programmers through convenient notation for declaring datatypes and for
defining functions over them by case analysis and fixpoint-style recursion
guarded by a type-based termination checker. We demonstrate that this does not
require extending CDLE by showing how datatypes and functions over them
elaborate to {\lambda}-encodings, and proving that this elaboration is type-
and value-preserving. This datatype subsystem and elaborator are implemented in
Cedille, establishing for the first time a complete translation of inductive
definitions to a small pure typed {\lambda}-calculus.

    <title>Relationship Estimation Metrics for Binary SoC Data</title>
    <summary>  System-on-Chip (SoC) designs are used in every aspect of computing and their
optimization is a difficult but essential task in today's competitive market.
Data taken from SoCs to achieve this is often characterised by very long
concurrent bit vectors which have unknown relationships to each other. This
paper explains and empirically compares the accuracy of several methods used to
detect the existence of these relationships in a wide range of systems. A
probabilistic model is used to construct and test a large number of SoC-like
systems with known relationships which are compared with the estimated
relationships to give accuracy scores. The metrics \.Cov and \.Dep based on
covariance and independence are demonstrated to be the most useful, whereas
metrics based on the Hamming distance and geometric approaches are shown to be
less useful for detecting the presence of relationships between SoC data.

    <title>Cardinal invariants of Haar null and Haar meager sets</title>
    <summary>  A subset $X$ of a Polish group $G$ is \emph{Haar null} if there exists a
Borel probability measure $\mu$ and a Borel set $B$ containing $X$ such that
$\mu(gBh)=0$ for every $g,h \in G$. A set $X$ is \emph{Haar meager} if there
exists a compact metric space $K$, a continuous function $f : K \to G$ and a
Borel set $B$ containing $X$ such that $f^{-1}(gBh)$ is meager in $K$ for every
$g,h \in G$. We calculate (in $ZFC$) the four cardinal invariants ($\rm add$,
$\rm cov$, $\rm non$, $\rm cof$) of these two $\sigma$-ideals for the simplest
non-locally compact Polish group, namely in the case $G = \mathbb{Z}^\omega$.
In fact, most results work for separable Banach spaces as well, and many
results work for Polish groups admitting a two-sided invariant metric. This
answers a question of the first named author and Z. Vidny\'anszky.

    <title>On first countable, cellular-compact spaces</title>
    <summary>  As it was introduced by Tkachuk and Wilson, a topological space $X$ is
cellular-compact if given any cellular, i.e. disjoint, family $\mathcal U$ of
non-empty open subsets of $X$ there is a compact subspace $K\subset X$ such
that $K\cap U\ne \emptyset$ for each $U\in \mathcal U$.
  Answering several questions raised by Tkachuk and Wilson we show that
  (1) any first countable cellular-compact $T_2$ space is $T_3$, and so its
cardinality is at most $\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\omega}$;
  (2) $cov(\mathcal M)&gt;{\omega}_1$ implies that every first countable and
separable cellular-compact $T_2$ space is compact;
  (3 if there is no $S$-space then any cellular-compact $T_3$ space of
countable spread is compact;
  (4) $MA_{{\omega}_1}$ implies that every point of a compact $T_2$ space of
countable spread has a disjoint local $\pi$-base.

    <title>3D-4D Interlinkage Of B-S Amplitudes : Unified View Of QQbar And QQQ
  Dynamics</title>
    <summary>  This article has a 3-fold objective: i) to provide a panoramic view of
several types of 3D vs 4D approaches in Field Theory (Tamm-Dancoff, Bethe
Salpeter Equation (BSE), Quasi-potentials, Light-Front Dynamics, etc) for
strong interaction dunamics; ii) to focus on the role of the Markov-Yukawa
Transversality Principle (MYTP) as a novel paradigm for an exact 3D-4D
interlinkage between the corresponding BSE amplitudes; iii) Stress on a closely
parallel treatment of $q{\bar q}$ and qqq BSE's stemming from a common
4-fermion Lagrangian mediated by gluon (vector)-like exchange. The two-way
interlinkage offered by MYTP between the 3D and 4D BSE forms via a
Lorentz-covariant 3D support to the BS kernel, gives it a unique status which
distinguishes it from most other 3D approaches to strong interaction dynamics,
which give at most a one-way connection. Two specific types of MYTP which
provide 3D support to the BSE kernel, are considered: a) Covariant
Instantaneity Ansatz (CIA); b) Covariant LF/NP ansatz (Cov.LF). Both lead to
formaly identical 3D BSE reductions (thus ensuring common spectral
predictions), but their 4D manifestations differ sharply: Under CIA, the 4D
loop integrals suffer from Lorentz mismatch of the vertex functions, leading to
ill-defined time-like momentum integrals, but Cov LF is free from this disease.
Some practical uses of MYTP as a basis for evaluating various types of 4D loop
integrals are outlined. PACS: 11.10 st ; 12.38 Lg ; 13.40.Fn Keywords:

    <title>On the Dimension and Euler characteristic of random graphs</title>
    <summary>  The inductive dimension dim(G) of a finite undirected graph G=(V,E) is a
rational number defined inductively as 1 plus the arithmetic mean of the
dimensions of the unit spheres dim(S(x)) at vertices x primed by the
requirement that the empty graph has dimension -1. We look at the distribution
of the random variable "dim" on the Erdos-Renyi probability space G(n,p), where
each of the n(n-1)/2 edges appears independently with probability p. We show
here that the average dimension E[dim] is a computable polynomial of degree
n(n-1)/2 in p. The explicit formulas allow experimentally to explore limiting
laws for the dimension of large graphs. We also study the expectation E[X] of
the Euler characteristic X, considered as a random variable on G(n,p). We look
experimentally at the statistics of curvature K(v) and local dimension dim(v) =
1+dim(S(v)) which satisfy the Gauss-Bonnet formula X(G) = sum K(v) and by
definition dim(G) = sum dim(v)/|V|. We also look at the signature functions
f(p)=E[dim], g(p)=E[X] and matrix values functions A(p) = Cov[{dim(v),dim(w)],
B(p) = Cov[K(v),K(w)] on the probability space G(p) of all subgraphs of a host
graph G=(V,E) with the same vertex set V, where each edge is turned on with
probability p. If G is the complete graph or a union of cyclic graphs with have
explicit formulas for the signature polynomials f and g.

    <title>"Quark Confinement" and Evolution of Covariant Hadron-Classification
  Scheme</title>
    <summary>  The extension of Non-Relativistic-to-Covariant classification scheme seems to
be an urgent problem in the Hadron Spectroscopy. Here are given the recent
results of our research. 1) Brief history of our way of the extension on
Kinematical Frameworks: from SU(2)_{sigma} $\otimes$ O(3)_{L} to U (4)_{DS,m}
(Tensor-space of Dirac Spinor with the static unitary symm. SU(2)_{m}, which is
new Mass-Reversal symm. reflecting the situation of Q.C.) $\otimes O(2)_{r\perp
v}$ (2-dim. internal spatial-vector r vertical to Boost-velocity v, embedded in
the O(3,1)_{Lorentz}). Also is brought in Cov. scheme the thus far Overlooked
Chirality Symm. of QCD/Stand. Gauge Model. 2) Propertime tau-Quantum Mechanics
for Conf. Q. System and Quantization of Comp. Hadron field is developed. The
similar to conventional procedures are performed in Lorentz-Inv. Particle Frame
(Galilean Inertial Frame with v=const) which becomes Lorentz-Cov. Observer F.,
when v=0. The one notable feature of the tau-Q.M. is concerned only
future-development, inducing the Crossing Rule; the other also inducing
Existence of the Chiral-Quark (JP=(1/2)-) in addition to Pauli-Quark
(JP=(1/2)+), which is Origin of SU(2)_m-symm., leading to Existence of
New-Exotics. 3) Evolved framework of hadron spectroscopy guided by tau-Q.M. is
summarized: Especially, "Regge Trajectories", in qqbar meson system are given
by $M^2$ vs. $\hat{N}(n,l)$; $M^2=M_{0}^2+N \Omega$ (N=2n+l), Intrinsic spin of
Comp. Hadrons J=S, where Orbital l contributes only to N. 4) New Classif.
scheme is applied to Phenomenology of Bottomonium System.As a result is shown
Remarkable Fact, including a serious Problem in the N.R. scheme, concerned on
Spin-Flip Mechanism of Heavy Quarks, seems to disappear in our scheme. This
seems to suggest that the phenomenological knowledge,thus far obtained
resorting on N.R.scheme, should be reexamined from the covariant one.

    <title>The Benefits and Costs of Social Distancing in Rich and Poor Countries</title>
    <summary>  Social distancing is the primary policy prescription for combating the
COVID-19 pandemic, and has been widely adopted in Europe and North America. We
estimate the value of disease avoidance using an epidemiological model that
projects the spread of COVID-19 across rich and poor countries. Social
distancing measures that "flatten the curve" of the disease to bring demand
within the capacity of healthcare systems are predicted to save many lives in
high-income countries, such that practically any economic cost is worth
bearing. These social distancing policies are estimated to be less effective in
poor countries with younger populations less susceptible to COVID-19, and more
limited healthcare systems, which were overwhelmed before the pandemic.
Moreover, social distancing lowers disease risk by limiting people's economic
opportunities. Poorer people are less willing to make those economic
sacrifices. They place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns
compared to contracting COVID-19. Not only are the epidemiological and economic
benefits of social distancing much smaller in poorer countries, such policies
may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the
informal sector lack the resources and social protections to isolate themselves
and sacrifice economic opportunities until the virus passes. By limiting their
ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger,
deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity. Rather than a blanket
adoption of social distancing measures, we advocate for the exploration of
alternative harm-reduction strategies, including universal mask adoption and
increased hygiene measures.

    <title>Relational Modeling for Robust and Efficient Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation
  in CT Scans</title>
    <summary>  Pulmonary lobe segmentation in computed tomography scans is essential for
regional assessment of pulmonary diseases. Recent works based on convolution
neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are
still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of
convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their
borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways,
and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a
critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are
affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD.
  In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages
structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network
module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships
among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights.
  With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we
initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the
COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models
pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate
RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation).
Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and
performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.

    <title>Controlling epidemic diseases based only on social distancing level</title>
    <summary>  The World Health Organization (WHO) made the assessment that COVID-19 can be
characterized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. To the COVID-19 outbreak, there
is no vaccination and no treatment. The only way to control the COVID-19
outbreak is sustained physical distancing. In this work, a simple control law
was proposed to keep the infected individuals during the COVID-19 outbreak
below the desired number. The proposed control law keeps the value of infected
individuals controlled only adjusting the social distancing level. The
stability analysis of the proposed control law is done and the uncertainties in
the parameters were considered. A version of the proposed controller to daily
update was developed. This is a very simple approach to the developed control
law and can be calculated in a spreadsheet. In the end, numerical simulations
were done to show the behavior of the number of infected individuals during an
epidemic disease when the proposed control law is used to adjust the social
distancing level.

    <title>Parameter Estimation from ICC curves</title>
    <summary>  Incidence - Cumulative Cases (ICC) curves are introduced and shown to provide
a simple framework for parameter identification in the case of the most
elementary epidemiological model, consisting of susceptible, infected, and
removed compartments. This novel methodology is used to estimate the basic
reproductive number of recent outbreaks, including the ongoing COVID-19
epidemic.

    <title>Model selection criteria for regression models with splines and the
  automatic localization of knots</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we propose a model selection approach to fit a regression model
using splines with a variable number of knots. We introduce a penalized
criterion to estimate the number and the position of the knots where to anchor
the splines basis. The method is evaluated on simulated data and applied to
covid-19 daily reported cases for short-term prediction.

    <title>MP Twitter Abuse in the Age of COVID-19: White Paper</title>
    <summary>  As COVID-19 sweeps the globe, outcomes depend on effective relationships
between the public and decision-makers. In the UK there were uncivil tweets to
MPs about perceived UK tardiness to go into lockdown. The pandemic has led to
increased attention on ministers with a role in the crisis. However, generally
this surge has been civil. Prime minister Boris Johnson's severe illness with
COVID-19 resulted in an unusual peak of supportive responses on Twitter. Those
who receive more COVID-19 mentions in their replies tend to receive less abuse
(significant negative correlation). Following Mr Johnson's recovery, with
rising economic concerns and anger about lockdown violations by influential
figures, abuse levels began to rise in May. 1,902 replies to MPs within the
study period were found containing hashtags or terms that refute the existence
of the virus (e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million
replies, or 9% of the number of mentions of "stay home save lives" and
variants). These have tended to be more abusive. Evidence of some members of
the public believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was also found. Higher
abuse levels were associated with hashtags blaming China for the pandemic.

    <title>A physicist view of the airborne infection</title>
    <summary>  Naturally produced droplets from humans (such as those produced by breathing,
talking, sneezing, and coughing) include several types of cells (e.g.,
epithelial cells and cells of the immune system), physiological electrolytes
contained in mucous and saliva (e.g. Na+, K+, Cl-), as well as, potentially,
several infectious agents (e.g. bacteria, fungi, and viruses). In response to
the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, which has become a major public
health issue worldwide, we provide a didactic overview of airborne germ
transmission as seen from a physics perspective. We also provide a
recommendation that could help to slow down the spread of the virus.

    <title>Feline coronaviruses associated with feline infectious peritonitis have
  modifications to spike protein activation sites at two discrete positions</title>
    <summary>  Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is associated with mutations in the
feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome that are thought to convert the subclinical
feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis
virus (FIPV). A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive
infection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell
tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP
progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have
shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation
site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike
(S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and
to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our
larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2
are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease
cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the
viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across
the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or
altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for
virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of
non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites.
These changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its
ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.

    <title>Networks in a World Unknown: Public WhatsApp Groups in the Venezuelan
  Refugee Crisis</title>
    <summary>  By early March 2020, five million Venezuelans had fled their home country
after its complete economic and institutional collapse, and over 1.6 million
have migrated to Colombia. Migrants struggle to start their lives over in
Colombia, having arrived with few economic resources, and often no legal
documentation, in cities with little to offer them. Venezuelan migrants,
however, rely heavily on mobile phones and social media networks as lifelines
for information, opportunities, and resources -- making WhatsApp both a
critical tool for migrants' settlement and integration, as well as an
invaluable source of data through which we can better understand migrant
experiences. This thesis explores the dynamics of public WhatsApp groups used
by Venezuelan migrants to Colombia, and what they can tell us about how
migrants use and share information. We center our research on information
spread and trust, especially as they intersect with concentration and
geographic heterogeneity within groups. We analyze messages and memberships
broadly, then explore interaction within groups, fake news and economic scams,
and effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Our results have a range of policy
implications, from reflections on Colombia's decision to shut its borders
amidst the coronavirus pandemic, to understandings of how aid organizations can
effectively share information over social media channels.

    <title>Is a COVID19 Quarantine Justified in Chile or USA Right Now?</title>
    <summary>  During the current COVID-19 pandemic it is imperative to give early warnings
to reduce mortality. However, non-specialist such as authorities and the
general population face several problems to understand the real thread of this
pandemic, and under/overestimation of its risk are a commonplace in the press
and social media. Here we define an index, which we call the COVID-19 Burden
Index, that relates the capacities of the healthcare system of a given country
to treat severe and critical cases. Its value is 0 if there is no extra strain
in the healthcare system, and it reaches 1.0 when the collapse is imminent. As
of 23 March 2020, we show that Chile, the USA, UK, among other countries, must
reduce the rate of infections right now, otherwise, in less than 7 days they
could be in a catastrophic situation such as Italy, Spain and Iran.

    <title>Mobile phone data and COVID-19: Missing an opportunity?</title>
    <summary>  This paper describes how mobile phone data can guide government and public
health authorities in determining the best course of action to control the
COVID-19 pandemic and in assessing the effectiveness of control measures such
as physical distancing. It identifies key gaps and reasons why this kind of
data is only scarcely used, although their value in similar epidemics has
proven in a number of use cases. It presents ways to overcome these gaps and
key recommendations for urgent action, most notably the establishment of mixed
expert groups on national and regional level, and the inclusion and support of
governments and public authorities early on. It is authored by a group of
experienced data scientists, epidemiologists, demographers and representatives
of mobile network operators who jointly put their work at the service of the
global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Challenges in control of Covid-19: short doubling time and long delay to
  effect of interventions</title>
    <summary>  Early assessments of the spreading rate of COVID-19 were subject to
significant uncertainty, as expected with limited data and difficulties in case
ascertainment, but more reliable inferences can now be made. Here, we estimate
from European data that COVID-19 cases are expected to double initially every
three days, until social distancing interventions slow this growth, and that
the impact of such measures is typically only seen nine days - i.e. three
doubling times - after their implementation. We argue that such temporal
patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the basic reproduction
number for initiating interventions. This observation has particular
implications for the low- and middle-income countries currently in the early
stages of their local epidemics.

    <title>Computational Drug Repositioning and Elucidation of Mechanism of Action
  of Compounds against SARS-CoV-2</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 crisis called for rapid reaction from all the fields of
biomedical research. Traditional drug development involves time consuming
pipelines that conflict with the urgence of identifying effective therapies
during a health and economic emergency. Drug repositioning, that is the
discovery of new clinical applications for drugs already approved for different
therapeutic contexts, could provide an effective shortcut to bring COVID-19
treatments to the bedside in a timely manner. Moreover, computational
approaches can help accelerate the process even further. Here we present the
application of computational drug repositioning tools based on transcriptomics
data to identify drugs that are potentially able to counteract SARS-CoV-2
infection, and also to provide insights on their mode of action. We believe
that mucolytics and HDAC inhibitors warrant further investigation. In addition,
we found that the DNA Mismatch repair pathway is strongly modulated by drugs
with experimental in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both full
results and methods are publicly available.

    <title>On the dynamics emerging from pandemics and infodemics</title>
    <summary>  This position paper discusses emerging behavioral, social, and economic
dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic and puts particular emphasis on two
emerging issues: First, delayed effects (or second strikes) of pandemics caused
by dread risk effects are discussed whereby two factors which might influence
the existence of such effects are identified, namely the accessibility of
(mis-)information and the effects of policy decisions on adaptive behavior.
Second, the issue of individual preparedness to hazardous events is discussed.
As events such as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds complex behavioral patterns
which are hard to predict, sophisticated models which account for behavioral,
social, and economic dynamics are required to assess the effectivity and
efficiency of decision-making.

    <title>Diffusive process under Lifshitz scaling and pandemic scenarios</title>
    <summary>  We here propose to model active cases data from COVID-19 by a continuous
effective model based on a modified diffusion equation under Lifshitz scaling
with a dynamic diffusion coefficient. The proposed model is rich enough to
capture different aspects of a complex virus diffusion as humanity has been
recently facing. The model being continuous it is bound to be solved
analytically and/or numerically. So, we investigate two possible models where
the diffusion coefficient associated with possible types of contamination are
captured by some specific profiles. The active cases curves here derived were
able to successfully describe the pandemic behavior of Germany and Spain.
Moreover, we also predict some scenarios for the evolution of COVID-19 in
Brazil. The scenarios unveil how the lockdown measures can flatten the
contamination curves. We can find the best profile of the diffusion coefficient
that better fit the real data of pandemic.

    <title>Disaster Resilience and Asset Prices</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates whether security markets price the effect of social
distancing on firms' operations. We document that firms that are more resilient
to social distancing significantly outperformed those with lower resilience
during the COVID-19 outbreak, even after controlling for the standard risk
factors. Similar cross-sectional return differentials already emerged before
the COVID-19 crisis: the 2014-19 cumulative return differential between more
and less resilient firms is of similar size as during the outbreak, suggesting
growing awareness of pandemic risk well in advance of its materialization.
Finally, we use stock option prices to infer the market's return expectations
after the onset of the pandemic: even at a two-year horizon, stocks of more
pandemic-resilient firms are expected to yield significantly lower returns than
less resilient ones, reflecting their lower exposure to disaster risk. Hence,
going forward, markets appear to price exposure to a new risk factor, namely,
pandemic risk.

    <title>Lung Segmentation from Chest X-rays using Variational Data Imputation</title>
    <summary>  Pulmonary opacification is the inflammation in the lungs caused by many
respiratory ailments, including the novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Chest X-rays (CXRs) with such opacifications render regions of lungs
imperceptible, making it difficult to perform automated image analysis on them.
In this work, we focus on segmenting lungs from such abnormal CXRs as part of a
pipeline aimed at automated risk scoring of COVID-19 from CXRs. We treat the
high opacity regions as missing data and present a modified CNN-based image
segmentation network that utilizes a deep generative model for data imputation.
We train this model on normal CXRs with extensive data augmentation and
demonstrate the usefulness of this model to extend to cases with extreme
abnormalities.

    <title>Do we need a Contact Tracing App?</title>
    <summary>  The goal of this paper is to shed some light on the usefulness of a contact
tracing smartphone app for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. We review
the basics of contact tracing during the spread of a virus, we contextualize
the numbers to the case of COVID-19 and we analyse the state of the art for
proximity detection using Bluetooth Low Energy. Our contribution is to assess
if there are scientific evidences that suggest a contact tracing app, using
present technologies, could be effective to slow down the spread of the virus.
Our conclusion is that such evidences are lacking, and we should re-think the
introduction of such a privacy-invasive measure.

    <title>Evaluating epidemic forecasts in an interval format</title>
    <summary>  For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization and death
counts in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic are issued in the form
of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for
the forecasts collected in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub run by the UMass-Amherst
Influenza Forecasting Center of Excellence. Forecast evaluation metrics like
the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease
forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive
distributions. This note provides an overview of how established methods for
the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic
forecasts. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the
weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the
continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization
of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a simple
decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and
underprediction.

    <title>New statistical model for misreported data with application to current
  public health challenges</title>
    <summary>  The main goal of this work is to present a new model able to deal with
potentially misreported continuous time series. The proposed model is able to
handle the autocorrelation structure in continuous time series data, which
might be partially or totally underreported or overreported. Its performance is
illustrated through a comprehensive simulation study considering several
autocorrelation structures and two real data applications on human
papillomavirus incidence in Girona (Catalunya, Spain) and COVID-19 incidence in
the Chinese region of Heilongjiang.

    <summary>  The goal of this note is to present a simple mathematical model with two
parameters for the number of deaths due to the corona (COVID-19) virus. The
model only requires basic knowledge in differential calculus, and can also be
understood by pupils attending secondary school. The model can easily be
implemented on a computer, and we will illustrate it on the basis of case
studies for different countries.

    <title>Accurate closed-form solution of the SIR epidemic model</title>
    <summary>  An accurate closed-form solution is obtained to the SIR Epidemic Model
through the use of Asymptotic Approximants (Barlow et. al, 2017, Q. Jl Mech.
Appl. Math, 70 (1), 21-48). The solution is created by analytically continuing
the divergent power series solution such that it matches the long-time
asymptotic behavior of the epidemic model. The utility of the analytical form
is demonstrated through its application to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>COVI White Paper</title>
    <summary>  The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic has caused significant strain on public
health institutions around the world. Contact tracing is an essential tool to
change the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. Manual contact tracing of Covid-19
cases has significant challenges that limit the ability of public health
authorities to minimize community infections. Personalized peer-to-peer contact
tracing through the use of mobile apps has the potential to shift the paradigm.
Some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems, but more
privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without
concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit
corporations. Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations
of standard digital tracing by incorporating many clues and their uncertainty
into a more graded and precise estimation of infection risk. The estimated risk
can provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant
information to the user. Finally, non-identifying risk data can inform
epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor.
These models can provide statistical evidence for the importance of factors
involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor, evaluate
and optimize health policy and (de)confinement scenarios according to medical
and economic productivity indicators. However, such a strategy based on mobile
apps and machine learning should proactively mitigate potential ethical and
privacy risks, which could have substantial impacts on society (not only
impacts on health but also impacts such as stigmatization and abuse of personal
data). Here, we present an overview of the rationale, design, ethical
considerations and privacy strategy of `COVI,' a Covid-19 public peer-to-peer
contact tracing and risk awareness mobile application developed in Canada.

    <title>Mixing properties of Skellam-GARCH processes</title>
    <summary>  We consider integer-valued GARCH processes, where the count variable
conditioned on past values of the count and state variables follows a so-called
Skellam distribution. Using arguments for contractive Markov chains we prove
that the process has a unique stationary regime. Furthermore, we show
asymptotic regularity ($\beta$-mixing) with geometrically decaying coefficients
for the count process. These probabilistic results are complemented by a
statistical analysis, a few simulations as well as an application to recent
COVID-19 data.

    <title>Conflict in Africa during COVID-19: social distancing, food
  vulnerability and welfare response</title>
    <summary>  We study the effect of social distancing, food vulnerability, welfare and
labour COVID-19 policy responses on riots, violence against civilians and
food-related conflicts. Our analysis uses georeferenced data for 24 African
countries with monthly local prices and real-time conflict data reported in the
Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) from January 2015 until
early May 2020. Lockdowns and recent welfare policies have been implemented in
light of COVID-19, but in some contexts also likely in response to ongoing
conflicts. To mitigate the potential risk of endogeneity, we use instrumental
variables. We exploit the exogeneity of global commodity prices, and three
variables that increase the risk of COVID-19 and efficiency in response such as
countries colonial heritage, male mortality rate attributed to air pollution
and prevalence of diabetes in adults. We find that the probability of
experiencing riots, violence against civilians, food-related conflicts and food
looting has increased since lockdowns. Food vulnerability has been a
contributing factor. A 10% increase in the local price index is associated with
an increase of 0.7 percentage points in violence against civilians.
Nonetheless, for every additional anti-poverty measure implemented in response
to COVID-19 the probability of experiencing violence against civilians, riots
and food-related conflicts declines by approximately 0.2 percentage points.
These anti-poverty measures also reduce the number of fatalities associated
with these conflicts. Overall, our findings reveal that food vulnerability has
increased conflict risks, but also offer an optimistic view of the importance
of the state in providing an extensive welfare safety net.

    <title>Eliminating COVID-19: The Impact of Travel and Timing</title>
    <summary>  We analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering the transmission of the
disease among individuals both within and between regions. A set of regions can
be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact
within each region far exceeds that between them. COVID-19 can be eliminated if
the region-to-region reproductive number---i.e. the average number of other
regions to which a single infected region will transmit the virus---is reduced
to less than one. We find that this region-to-region reproductive number is
proportional to the travel rate between regions and exponential in the length
of the time-delay before region-level control measures are imposed. Thus,
reductions in travel and the speed with which regions take action play decisive
roles in whether COVID-19 is eliminated from a collection of regions. If, on
average, infected regions (including those that become re-infected in the
future) impose social distancing measures shortly after active spreading begins
within them, the number of infected regions, and thus the number of regions in
which such measures are required, will exponentially decrease over time.
Elimination will in this case be a stable fixed point even after the social
distancing measures have been lifted from most of the regions.

    <title>Comprehensive Named Entity Recognition on CORD-19 with Distant or Weak
  Supervision</title>
    <summary>  We created this CORD-NER dataset with comprehensive named entity recognition
(NER) on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) corpus
(2020-03-13). This CORD-NER dataset covers 75 fine-grained entity types: In
addition to the common biomedical entity types (e.g., genes, chemicals and
diseases), it covers many new entity types related explicitly to the COVID-19
studies (e.g., coronaviruses, viral proteins, evolution, materials, substrates
and immune responses), which may benefit research on COVID-19 related virus,
spreading mechanisms, and potential vaccines. CORD-NER annotation is a
combination of four sources with different NER methods. The quality of CORD-NER
annotation surpasses SciSpacy (over 10% higher on the F1 score based on a
sample set of documents), a fully supervised BioNER tool. Moreover, CORD-NER
supports incrementally adding new documents as well as adding new entity types
when needed by adding dozens of seeds as the input examples. We will constantly
update CORD-NER based on the incremental updates of the CORD-19 corpus and the
improvement of our system.

    <title>ACDC-Tracing: Towards Anonymous Citizen-Driven Contact Tracing</title>
    <summary>  As we enter the control phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, many efforts have
been dedicated to developing smartphone-based contact tracing apps in order to
automatically identify people that a person with COVID-19 might have infected.
These applications while potentially useful, present significant adoption,
societal, technical and privacy challenges.
  We propose ACDC-Tracing, a simpler, anonymous, voucher-based contact tracing
solution that relies on peoples' knowledge of their own close contacts. People
who test positive are given an anonymous voucher which they can share with a
limited number of people whom they think they might be infected. The recipients
can use this voucher to book a COVID-19 test and can receive their test results
without ever revealing their identity. People receiving positive result are
given vouchers to further backtrack the path of infection.
  This is a fully anonymous solution which does not require any sharing of
location data, Bluetooth, or having an app installed on people's mobile device.
Moreover, ACDC-Tracing can be tested for effectiveness at a small scale without
requiring adoption by the entire population, which would enable acquiring fast
evidence about its efficacy and scalability. Finally, it is compatible with and
complementary to alternative approaches to contact tracing.

    <title>A Spatiotemporal Epidemic Model to Quantify the Effects of Contact
  Tracing, Testing, and Containment</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the current COVID-19 outbreak, we introduce a novel epidemic
model based on marked temporal point processes that is specifically designed to
make fine-grained spatiotemporal predictions about the course of the disease in
a population. Our model can make use and benefit from data gathered by a
variety of contact tracing technologies and it can quantify the effects that
different testing and tracing strategies, social distancing measures, and
business restrictions may have on the course of the disease. Building on our
model, we use Bayesian optimization to estimate the risk of exposure of each
individual at the sites they visit, the percentage of symptomatic individuals,
and the difference in transmission rate between asymptomatic and symptomatic
individuals from historical longitudinal testing data. Experiments using real
COVID-19 data and mobility patterns from T\"{u}bingen, a town in the southwest
of Germany, demonstrate that our model can be used to quantify the effects of
tracing, testing, and containment strategies at an unprecedented spatiotemporal
resolution. To facilitate research and informed policy-making, particularly in
the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we are releasing an open-source
implementation of our framework at https://github.com/covid19-model.

    <title>An Early Study on Intelligent Analysis of Speech under COVID-19:
  Severity, Sleep Quality, Fatigue, and Anxiety</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 outbreak was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health
Organisation in March 2020 and has affected a growing number of people in the
past few weeks. In this context, advanced artificial intelligence techniques
are brought to the fore in responding to fight against and reduce the impact of
this global health crisis. In this study, we focus on developing some potential
use-cases of intelligent speech analysis for COVID-19 diagnosed patients. In
particular, by analysing speech recordings from these patients, we construct
audio-only-based models to automatically categorise the health state of
patients from four aspects, including the severity of illness, sleep quality,
fatigue, and anxiety. For this purpose, two established acoustic feature sets
and support vector machines are utilised. Our experiments show that an average
accuracy of .69 obtained estimating the severity of illness, which is derived
from the number of days in hospitalisation. We hope that this study can foster
an extremely fast, low-cost, and convenient way to automatically detect the
COVID-19 disease.

    <title>Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing</title>
    <summary>  This document describes and analyzes a system for secure and
privacy-preserving proximity tracing at large scale. This system, referred to
as DP3T, provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who
might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures
to break its transmission chain. The system aims to minimise privacy and
security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level
of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine
who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus
exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where the
contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that
continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user's
phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close
proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload
pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server.
Prior to the upload, all data remains exclusively on the user's phone. Other
users' apps can use data from the server to locally estimate whether the
device's owner was exposed to the virus through close-range physical proximity
to a COVID-19 positive person who has uploaded their data. In case the app
detects a high risk, it will inform the user.

    <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Regional Lockdown Policies in the
  Containment of Covid-19: Evidence from Pakistan</title>
    <summary>  To slow down the spread of Covid-19, administrative regions within Pakistan
imposed complete and partial lockdown restrictions on socio-economic
activities, religious congregations, and human movement. Here we examine the
impact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting
econometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial
Regressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)
Pakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of
Covid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of
reduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no
lockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four
regions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),
and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns
did not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest
provinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional
heterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of
lockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.

    <title>Misinformation Has High Perplexity</title>
    <summary>  Debunking misinformation is an important and time-critical task as there
could be adverse consequences when misinformation is not quashed promptly.
However, the usual supervised approach to debunking via misinformation
classification requires human-annotated data and is not suited to the fast
time-frame of newly emerging events such as the COVID-19 outbreak. In this
paper, we postulate that misinformation itself has higher perplexity compared
to truthful statements, and propose to leverage the perplexity to debunk false
claims in an unsupervised manner. First, we extract reliable evidence from
scientific and news sources according to sentence similarity to the claims.
Second, we prime a language model with the extracted evidence and finally
evaluate the correctness of given claims based on the perplexity scores at
debunking time. We construct two new COVID-19-related test sets, one is
scientific, and another is political in content, and empirically verify that
our system performs favorably compared to existing systems. We are releasing
these datasets publicly to encourage more research in debunking misinformation
on COVID-19 and other topics.

    <title>EDGE COVID-19: A Web Platform to generate submission-ready genomes for
  SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts</title>
    <summary>  Genomics has become a pivotal technology for understanding emerging outbreaks
of infectious diseases. A wide range of technologies and strategies for
pathogen genome enrichment and sequencing are being used by laboratories and
institutes, resulting in different analytical procedures for generating genome
sequences and resulting in non-standard entries of varying quality into public
repositories. A standardized analytical process for genome sequence generation,
particularly for outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are critical
to provide scientists with a solid genomic basis for epidemiology analyses and
for making well-informed decisions. To address this challenge, we have
developed a web platform (EDGE COVID-19) to run standardized workflows for
reference-based genome assembly and to perform further analysis of Illumina or
Oxford Nanopore Technologies data for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing projects.
Given a raw Illumina or Oxford Nanopore FASTQ read file, this web platform
automates the production of a SARS-CoV-2 genome that is ready for submission to
GISAID or GenBank. EDGE COVID-19 is open-source software that is available as a
web application for public use at https://covid19.edgebioinformatics.org, and
as a Docker container at https://hub.docker.com/r/bioedge/edge-covid19 for
local installation.

    <title>Evolution of speckle during spinodal decomposition</title>
    <summary>  Time-dependent properties of the speckled intensity patterns created by
scattering coherent radiation from materials undergoing spinodal decomposition
are investigated by numerical integration of the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook equation.
For binary systems which obey a local conservation law, the characteristic
domain size is known to grow in time $\tau$ as $R = [B \tau]^n$ with n=1/3,
where B is a constant. The intensities of individual speckles are found to be
nonstationary, persistent time series. The two-time intensity covariance at
wave vector ${\bf k}$ can be collapsed onto a scaling function $Cov(\delta
t,\bar{t})$, where $\delta t = k^{1/n} B |\tau_2-\tau_1|$ and $\bar{t} =
k^{1/n} B (\tau_1+\tau_2)/2$. Both analytically and numerically, the covariance
is found to depend on $\delta t$ only through $\delta t/\bar{t}$ in the
small-$\bar{t}$ limit and $\delta t/\bar{t} ^{1-n}$ in the large-$\bar{t}$
limit, consistent with a simple theory of moving interfaces that applies to any
universality class described by a scalar order parameter. The speckle-intensity
covariance is numerically demonstrated to be equal to the square of the
two-time structure factor of the scattering material, for which an analytic
scaling function is obtained for large $\bar{t}.$ In addition, the two-time,
two-point order-parameter correlation function is found to scale as
$C(r/(B^n\sqrt{\tau_1^{2n}+\tau_2^{2n}}),\tau_1/\tau_2)$, even for quite large
distances $r$. The asymptotic power-law exponent for the autocorrelation
function is found to be $\lambda \approx 4.47$, violating an upper bound
conjectured by Fisher and Huse.

    <title>Soft-QCD Effects In B to gamma gamma Decay: Quark Level Form Factors</title>
    <summary>  Soft-QCD effects of quark-level form factors in $\gamma\gamma$ decay of
$B_s$-mesons via $D{\bar D}$ intermediate states, suggested by Ellis et al, are
examined in the "Salpeter" model [reinterpreted in terms of the Markov-Yukawa
Transversality Principle (MYTP)] when formulated on a covariant light front
(null-plane). The gluonic kernel in the infrared regime which generates the
constituent mass via standard $DB{\chi}S$, is calibrated to both $q{\bar q}$
and qqq spectra, meson mass splittings, pion form factor,and other parameters.
With this check, an exact evaluation of the $D{\bar D}\gamma$ vertex form
factor $F(\alpha)$ (normalized to F(0)=1), gives a multiplicative effect of
$F^2(\alpha)$ on the $B_s \Rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ amplitude via D-meson
triangle loop, where $\alpha$ = $(p^2+M^2)/M^2$ is the off-shellness parameter
of the exchanged D-meson of mass M and 4-momentum $p_\mu$, and is a variables
of the (internal)loop integration. Unfortunately, the $F^2(\alpha)$ effect
decreases the loop amplitude by a factor of 30 w.r.t. the point hadron value,
resulting in a reduction of 3 orders of magnitude in long distance (hadronic)
contributions to the $B_s \Rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay rate, thus greatly
impairing the visibility of such modes. PACS: 11.10.St ; 12.38.Lg ; 13.20.Gd ;

    <title>Infinitesimal Operations on Complexes of Graphs</title>
    <summary>  In two seminal papers Kontsevich used a construction called_graph homology_
as a bridge between certain infinite dimensional Lie algebras and various
topological objects, including moduli spaces of curves, the group of outer
automorphisms of a free group, and invariants of odd dimensional manifolds. In
this paper, we show that Kontsevich's graph complexes, which include graph
complexes studied earlier by Culler and Vogtmann and by Penner, have a rich
algebraic structure. We define a Lie bracket and cobracket on graph complexes,
and in fact show that they are Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras, and therefore
Gerstenhaber algebras. We also find natural subcomplexes on which the bracket
and cobracket are compatible as a Lie bialgebra.
  Kontsevich's graph complex construction was generalized to the context of
operads by Ginzburg and Kapranov, with later generalizations by
Getzler-Kapranov and Markl. In [CoV], we show that Kontsevich's results in fact
extend to general cyclic operads. For some operads, including the examples
associated to moduli space and outer automorphism groups of free groups, the
subcomplex on which we have a Lie bi-algebra structure is quasi-isomorphic to
the entire connected graph complex. In the present paper we show that all of
the new algebraic operations canonically vanish when the homology functor is
applied, and we expect that the resulting constraints will be useful in
studying the homology of the mapping class group, finite type manifold
invariants and the homology of Out(F_n).

    <title>Algebraic methods toward higher-order probability inequalities, II</title>
    <summary>  Let (L,\preccurlyeq) be a finite distributive lattice, and suppose that the
functions f_1,f_2:L\to R are monotone increasing with respect to the partial
order \preccurlyeq. Given \mu a probability measure on L, denote by E(f_i) the
average of f_i over L with respect to \mu, i=1,2. Then the
  FKG inequality provides a condition on the measure \mu under which the
covariance, Cov(f_1,f_2):=E(f_1f_2)-E(f_1)E(f_2), is nonnegative. In this paper
we derive a ``third-order'' generalization of the FKG inequality.
  We also establish fourth- and fifth-order generalizations of the FKG
inequality and formulate a conjecture for a general mth-order generalization.
For functions and measures on R^n we establish these inequalities by extending
the method of diffusion processes. We provide several applications of the
third-order inequality, generalizing earlier applications of the FKG
inequality.
  Finally, we remark on some connections between the theory of total positivity
and the existence of inequalities of FKG-type within the context of Riemannian
manifolds.

    <title>Positional distribution of human transcription factor binding sites</title>
    <summary>  We developed a method for estimating the positional distribution of
transcription fac-tor (TF) binding sites using ChIP-chip data, and applied it
to recently published experiments on binding sites of nine TFs; OCT4, SOX2,
NANOG, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF6, FOXA2, USF1 and CREB1. The data were obtained from a
genome-wide cov-erage of promoter regions from 8kb upstream of the
Transcription Start Site (TSS) to 2kb downstream. The number of target genes of
each TF ranges from few hundred to several thousand. We found that for each of
the nine TFs the estimated binding site distribution is closely approximated by
a mixture of two components: a narrow peak, localized within 300 base pairs
upstream of the TSS, and a distribution of almost uni-form density within the
tested region. Using Gene Ontology and Enrichment analysis, we were able to
associate (for each of the TFs studied) the target genes of both types of
binding with known biological processes. Most GO terms were enriched either
among the proximal targets or among those with a uniform distribution of
binding sites. For example, the three stemness-related TFs have several hundred
target genes that belong to "development" and "morphogenesis" whose binding
sites belong to the uniform dis-tribution.

    <title>Selective covering properties of product spaces</title>
    <summary>  We study the preservation of selective covering properties, including classic
ones introduced by Menger, Hurewicz, Rothberger, Gerlits and Nagy, and others,
under products with some major families of concentrated sets of reals.
  Our methods include the projection method introduced by the authors in an
earlier work, as well as several new methods. Some special consequences of our
main results are (definitions provided in the paper): \be
  \item Every product of a concentrated space with a Hurewicz $\sone(\Ga,\Op)$
space satisfies $\sone(\Ga,\Op)$. On the other hand, assuming \CH{}, for each
Sierpi\'nski set $S$ there is a Luzin set $L$ such that $L\x S$ can be mapped
onto the real line by a Borel function.
  \item Assuming Semifilter Trichotomy, every concentrated space is
productively Menger and productively Rothberger.
  \item Every scale set is productively Hurewicz, productively Menger,
productively Scheepers, and productively Gerlits--Nagy.
  \item Assuming $\fd=\aleph_1$, every productively Lindel\"of space is
productively Hurewicz, productively Menger, and productively Scheepers. \ee
  A notorious open problem asks whether the additivity of Rothberger's property
may be strictly greater than $\add(\cN)$, the additivity of the ideal of
Lebesgue-null sets of reals. We obtain a positive answer, modulo the
consistency of Semifilter Trichotomy with $\add(\cN)&lt;\cov(\cM)$.
  Our results improve upon and unify a number of results, established earlier
by many authors.

    <title>Extremes of homogeneous Gaussian random fields</title>
    <summary>  Let $\{X(s,t):s,t\geqslant 0\}$ be a centered homogeneous Gaussian field with
a.s. continuous sample paths and correlation function
$r(s,t)=Cov(X(s,t),X(0,0))$ such that
\[r(s,t)=1-|s|^{\alpha_1}-|t|^{\alpha_2}+o(|s|^{\alpha_1}+|t|^{\alpha_2}),
\quad s,t \to 0,\] with $\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in(0,2],$ and $r(s,t)&lt;1$ for
$(s,t)\neq(0,0)$. In this contribution we derive an exact asymptotic expansion
(as $u\to \infty$) of $$\mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{(s n_1(u),t
n_2(u))\in\left[0,x\right]\times\left[0,y\right]}X(s,t)\leqslant u\right),$$
where $n_1(u)n_2(u)=u^{2/\alpha_1+2/\alpha_2}\Psi(u)$, which holds uniformly
for $(x,y) \in [ A , B ]^2$ with $ A , B $ two positive constants and $\Psi$
the survival function of an $N(0,1)$ random variable. We apply our findings to
the analysis of asymptotics of extremes of homogeneous Gaussian fields over
more complex parameter sets and a ball of random radius. Additionally we
determine the extremal index of the discretised random field determined by
$X(s,t)$.

    <title>Between countably compact and $ω$-bounded</title>
    <summary>  Given a property $P$ of subspaces of a $T_1$ space $X$, we say that $X$ is
{\em $P$-bounded} iff every subspace of $X$ with property $P$ has compact
closure in $X$. Here we study $P$-bounded spaces for the properties $P \in
\{\omega D, \omega N, C_2 \}$ where $\omega D \, \equiv$ "countable discrete",
$\omega N \, \equiv$ "countable nowhere dense", and $C_2 \,\equiv$ "second
countable". Clearly, for each of these $P$-bounded is between countably compact
and $\omega$-bounded.
  We give examples in ZFC that separate all these boundedness properties and
their appropriate combinations. Consistent separating examples with better
properties (such as: smaller cardinality or weight, local compactness, first
countability) are also produced.
  We have interesting results concerning $\omega D$-bounded spaces which show
that $\omega D$-boundedness is much stronger than countable compactness:
  $\bullet$ Regular $\omega D$-bounded spaces of Lindel\"of degree $&lt;
cov(\mathcal{M})$ are $\omega$-bounded.
  $\bullet$ Regular $\omega D$-bounded spaces of countable tightness are
$\omega N$-bounded, and if $\mathfrak{b} &gt; \omega_1$ then even
$\omega$-bounded.
  $\bullet$ If a product of Hausdorff space is $\omega D$-bounded then all but
one of its factors must be $\omega$-bounded.
  $\bullet$ Any product of at most $\mathfrak{t}$ many Hausdorff $\omega
D$-bounded spaces is countably compact.
  As a byproduct we obtain that regular, countably tight, and countably compact
spaces are discretely generated.

    <title>Automated Selection of Uniform Regions for CT Image Quality Detection</title>
    <summary>  CT images are widely used in pathology detection and follow-up treatment
procedures. Accurate identification of pathological features requires
diagnostic quality CT images with minimal noise and artifact variation. In this
work, a novel Fourier-transform based metric for image quality (IQ) estimation
is presented that correlates to additive CT image noise. In the proposed
method, two windowed CT image subset regions are analyzed together to identify
the extent of variation in the corresponding Fourier-domain spectrum. The two
square windows are chosen such that their center pixels coincide and one window
is a subset of the other. The Fourier-domain spectral difference between these
two sub-sampled windows is then used to isolate spatial regions-of-interest
(ROI) with low signal variation (ROI-LV) and high signal variation (ROI-HV),
respectively. Finally, the spatial variance ($var$), standard deviation
($std$), coefficient of variance ($cov$) and the fraction of abdominal ROI
pixels in ROI-LV ($\nu'(q)$), are analyzed with respect to CT image noise. For
the phantom CT images, $var$ and $std$ correlate to CT image noise ($|r|&gt;0.76$
($p\ll0.001$)), though not as well as $\nu'(q)$ ($r=0.96$ ($p\ll0.001$)).
However, for the combined phantom and patient CT images, $var$ and $std$ do not
correlate well with CT image noise ($|r|&lt;0.46$ ($p\ll0.001$)) as compared to
$\nu'(q)$ ($r=0.95$ ($p\ll0.001$)). Thus, the proposed method and the metric,
$\nu'(q)$, can be useful to quantitatively estimate CT image noise.

    <title>Correlations from generalized thermodynamics</title>
    <summary>  In order to account for possible nonstatistical fluctuations in a hadronizing
system (leading to the characteristic power-like behavior of the respective
single particle spectra and to the broadening of the corresponding
multiparticle distributions) while using the statistical approach one has to
resort to its nonextensive version. The new parameter q appearing there is
directly connected to the variance of the particular variable X, q =
1+Var(X)/&lt;X&gt;^2 (with q = 1 for the usual statistical model). We shall
demonstrate here how such an approach allows us to compose fluctuations of
different observables (described by their respective parameters q) leading to a
characteristic sum rule connecting q's deduced from measurements of these
observables, which can be verified experimentally. We shall also discuss
ensembles in which all relevant quantities, namely the energy (U), temperature
(T) and multiplicity (N), can fluctuate. A specific relation connecting all
these fluctuating variables is proposed. It generalizes the so called Lindhard
thermodynamic uncertainty relations known in the literature, by introducing, in
a natural way, a possibility of correlations between the fluctuating variables
considered. This point is illustrated using an example from the multiparticle
production processes. We show that fluctuations from different parts of phase
space (characterized by different parameters q) are correlated and that the
strength of these correlations is a function of these q's, Cov(U,T) = F({q}).
These correlations can be tested experimentally. Some rough first estimates,
using available data, are presented.

    <title>Towards Faster Training of Global Covariance Pooling Networks by
  Iterative Matrix Square Root Normalization</title>
    <summary>  Global covariance pooling in convolutional neural networks has achieved
impressive improvement over the classical first-order pooling. Recent works
have shown matrix square root normalization plays a central role in achieving
state-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods depend heavily on
eigendecomposition (EIG) or singular value decomposition (SVD), suffering from
inefficient training due to limited support of EIG and SVD on GPU. Towards
addressing this problem, we propose an iterative matrix square root
normalization method for fast end-to-end training of global covariance pooling
networks. At the core of our method is a meta-layer designed with loop-embedded
directed graph structure. The meta-layer consists of three consecutive
nonlinear structured layers, which perform pre-normalization, coupled matrix
iteration and post-compensation, respectively. Our method is much faster than
EIG or SVD based ones, since it involves only matrix multiplications, suitable
for parallel implementation on GPU. Moreover, the proposed network with ResNet
architecture can converge in much less epochs, further accelerating network
training. On large-scale ImageNet, we achieve competitive performance superior
to existing counterparts. By finetuning our models pre-trained on ImageNet, we
establish state-of-the-art results on three challenging fine-grained
benchmarks. The source code and network models will be available at

    <title>The Higher Cichoń Diagram</title>
    <summary>  For a strongly inacessible cardinal $\kappa$, we investigate the
relationships between the following ideals:
  - the ideal of meager sets in the ${&lt;}\kappa$-box product topology
  - the ideal of "null" sets in the sense of [Sh:1004] (arXiv:1202.5799)
  - the ideal of nowhere stationary subsets of a (naturally defined) stationary
set $S_{\rm pr}^\kappa \subseteq \kappa$.
  In particular, we analyse the provable inequalities between the cardinal
characteristics for these ideals, and we give consistency results showing that
certain inequalities are unprovable.
  While some results from the classical case ($\kappa=\omega$) can be easily
generalized to our setting, some key results (such as a Fubini property for the
ideal of null sets) do not hold; this leads to the surprising inequality
cov(null)$\le$non(null). Also, concepts that did not exist in the classical
case (in particular, the notion of stationary sets) will turn out to be
relevant.
  We construct several models to distinguish the various cardinal
characteristics; the main tools are iterations with $\mathord&lt;\kappa$-support
(and a strong "Knaster" version of $\kappa^+$-cc) and one iteration with
${\le}\kappa$-support (and a version of $\kappa$-properness).

    <title>Some Insights on Synthesizing Optimal Linear Quadratic Controller Using
  Krotov's Sufficiency Conditions</title>
    <summary>  This paper revisits the problem of optimal control law design for linear
systems using the global optimal control framework introduced by Vadim Krotov.
Krotov's approach is based on the idea of total decomposition of the original
optimal control problem (OCP) with respect to time, by an $ad$ $hoc$ choice of
the so-called Krotov's function or solving function, thereby providing
sufficient conditions for the existence of global solution based on another
optimization problem, which is completely equivalent to the original OCP. It is
well known that the solution of this equivalent optimization problem is
obtained using an iterative method. In this paper, we propose suitable Krotov's
functions for linear quadratic OCP and subsequently, show that by imposing
convexity condition on this equivalent optimization problem, there is no need
to compute an iterative solution. We also give some key insights into the
solution procedure of the linear quadratic OCP using the proposed methodology
in contrast to the celebrated Calculus of Variations (CoV) and
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation based approach.

    <title>Test for homogeneity with unordered paired observations</title>
    <summary>  In some applications, an experimental unit is composed of two distinct but
related subunits. The response from such a unit is $(X_{1}, X_{2})$ but we
observe only $Y_1 = \min\{X_{1},X_{2}\}$ and $Y_2 = \max\{X_{1},X_{2}\}$, i.e.,
the subunit identities are not observed. We call $(Y_1, Y_2)$ unordered paired
observations. Based on unordered paired observations $\{(Y_{1i},
Y_{2i})\}_{i=1}^n$, we are interested in whether the marginal distributions for
$X_1$ and $X_2$ are identical. Testing methods are available in the literature
under the assumptions that $Var(X_1) = Var(X_2)$ and $Cov(X_1, X_2) = 0$.
However, by extensive simulation studies, we observe that when one or both
assumptions are violated, these methods have inflated type I errors or much
lower powers. In this paper, we study the likelihood ratio test statistics for
various scenarios and explore their limiting distributions without these
restrictive assumptions. Furthermore, we develop Bartlett correction formulae
for these statistics to enhance their precision when the sample size is not
large. Simulation studies and real-data examples are used to illustrate the
efficacy of the proposed methods.

    <title>A computational insight of the improved nicotine binding with
  ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex with its clinical impact</title>
    <summary>  Smokers being witnessed with the mild adverse clinical symptoms of
SARS-CoV-2, the in-silico study is intended to explore the effect of nicotine
binding to the soluble angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor with or
without SARS-CoV-2 binding. Nicotine established a stable interaction with the
conserved amino acid residues: Asp382, Gly405, His378 and Tyr385 through His401
of the soluble ACE2 that seals its interaction with the INS1. Also, nicotine
binding has significantly reduced the affinity score of ACE2 with INS1 to -12.6
kcal/mol (versus -15.7 kcal/mol without nicotine) and the interface area to
1933.6 square Angstrom (versus 2057.3 square Angstrom without nicotine).
Nicotine exhibited a higher binding affinity score with ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex
with -6.33 kcal/mol (Vs -5.24 kcal/mol without SARS-CoV-2) and a lowered
inhibitory contant value of 22.95 micromolar (Vs 151.69 micromolar without
SARS-CoV). Eventhough ACE2 is not a potential receptor for nicotine binding in
the healthy people, in COVID19 patients, it may exhibit better binding affinity
with the ACE2 receptor. In overall, nicotines strong preference for
ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex might drastically reduce the SARS-CoV-2 virulence by
intervening the ACE2 conserved residues interaction with the spike (S1) protein
of SARS-CoV-2.

    <title>Droplet evaporation residue indicating SARS-COV-2 survivability on
  surfaces</title>
    <summary>  SARS-CoV-2 survives and remains viable on surfaces for several days under
different environments as reported in recent studies. However, it is unclear
how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies
across different surfaces. To address these questions, we conduct systematic
experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer
and human-exhaled gas on surfaces. We found that these droplets do not
disappear with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers
(referred to as residues), persist for more than 24 hours, and are highly
durable against changes of environmental conditions. The characteristics of
these residues change significantly across surface types. Specifically,
surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable
residues, while stainless steel, plastic, and glass surfaces form residues from
a varying fraction of all deposited droplets at 40% relative humidity. Lowering
humidity level suppresses the formation of residues while increasing humidity
level enhances it. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can
potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes, allowing them to
survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations
after deposition. Our findings can also be extended to other viruses
transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., SARS-CoV, flu viruses, etc.),
and can thus lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces and other
prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting viral transmission.

    <title>A Time Delay Dynamic System with External Source for the Local Outbreak
  of 2019-nCoV</title>
    <summary>  How to model the 2019 CoronaVirus (2019-nCov) spread in China is one of the
most urgent and interesting problems in applied mathematics. In this paper, we
propose a novel time delay dynamic system with external source to describe the
trend of local outbreak for the 2019-nCoV. The external source is introduced in
the newly proposed dynamic system, which can be considered as the suspected
people travel to different areas. The numerical simulations exhibit the dynamic
system with the external source is more reliable than the one without it, and
the rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of
cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV. Based on our numerical simulation
results with the public data, we suggest that the local government should have
some more strict measures to maintain the rate of isolation. Otherwise the
local cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out of control.

    <title>Protein structure and sequence re-analysis of 2019-nCoV genome does not
  indicate snakes as its intermediate host or the unique similarity between its
  spike protein insertions and HIV-1</title>
    <summary>  As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global
pneumonia epidemic, careful analysis of its transmission and cellular
mechanisms is sorely needed. In this report, we re-analyzed the computational
approaches and findings presented in two recent manuscripts by Ji et al.
(https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25682) and by Pradhan et al.
(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871), which concluded that snakes are
the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein
insertions shared a unique similarity to HIV-1. Results from our
re-implementation of the analyses, built on larger-scale datasets using
state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, do not support the
conclusions proposed by these manuscripts. Based on our analyses and existing
data of coronaviruses, we concluded that the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV
are more likely to be mammals and birds than snakes, and that the "novel
insertions" observed in the spike protein are naturally evolved from bat
coronaviruses.

    <title>A Robust Stochastic Method of Estimating the Transmission Potential of
  2019-nCoV</title>
    <summary>  The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has quickly evolved
into a global health crisis. The transmission potential of 2019-nCoV has been
modelled and studied in several recent research works. The key factors such as
the basic reproductive number, $R_{0}$, of the virus have been identified by
fitting contagious disease spreading models to aggregated data. The data
include the reported cases both within China and in closely connected cities
over the world. In this paper, we study the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV
from the perspective of the robustness of the statistical estimation, in light
of varying data quality and timeliness in the initial stage of the outbreak.
Sample consensus algorithm has been adopted to improve model fitting when
outliers are present. The robust estimation enables us to identify two clusters
of transmission models, both are of substantial concern, one with
$R_0:8\sim14$, comparable to that of measles and the other dictates a large
initial infected group.

    <title>Efficient identification of infected sub-population</title>
    <summary>  When testing for infections, the standard method is to test each subject
individually. If testing methodology is such that samples from multiple
subjects can be efficiently combined and tested at once, yielding a positive
results if any one subject in the subgroup is positive, then one can often
identify the infected sub-population with a considerably lower number of tests
compared to the number of test subjects. We present two such methods that allow
an increase in testing efficiency (in terms of total number of test performed)
by a factor of $\approx$ 10 if population infection rate is $10^{-2}$ and a
factor of $\approx$50 when it is $10^{-3}$. Such methods could be useful when
testing large fractions of the total population, as will be perhaps required
during the current coronavirus pandemic.

    <title>Deciphering the Protein Motion of S1 Subunit in SARS-CoV-2 Spike
  Glycoprotein Through Integrated Computational Methods</title>
    <summary>  The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a
major worldwide public health emergency that has infected over $1.5$ million
people. The partially open state of S1 subunit in spike glycoprotein is
considered vital for its infection with host cell and is represented as a key
target for neutralizing antibodies. However, the mechanism elucidating the
transition from the closed state to the partially open state still remains
unclear. Here, we applied a combination of Markov state model, transition path
theory and random forest to analyze the S1 motion. Our results explored a
promising complete conformational movement of receptor-binding domain, from
buried, partially open, to detached states. We also numerically confirmed the
transition probability between those states. Based on the asymmetry in both the
dynamics behavior and backbone C$\alpha$ importance, we further suggested a
relation between chains in the trimer spike protein, which may help in the
vaccine design and antibody neutralization.

    <title>Variation of positiveness to enhance testing of specimens during an
  epidemic</title>
    <summary>  Rapid testing of appropriate specimens from patients suspected for a disease
during an epidemic, such as the current Coronavirus outbreak, is of a great
importance for the disease management and control. We propose a method to
enhance processing large amounts of collected samples. The method is based on
mixing samples in testing tubes in a specific configuration, as opposed to
testing single samples in each tube, and accounting for natural virus amounts
in infected patients from variation of positiveness in test tubes. To
illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method we carry out numerical tests
for actual scenarios under various tests. Applying the proposed method enhances
the number of tests by order of magnitudes, where all positives are identified
with no false negatives, and the effective testing time can be reduced
drastically even when the uncertainty in the test is relatively high.

    <title>Evolutionary Multi-Objective Design of SARS-CoV-2 Protease Inhibitor
  Candidates</title>
    <summary>  Computational drug design based on artificial intelligence is an emerging
research area. At the time of writing this paper, the world suffers from an
outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. A promising way to stop the virus
replication is via protease inhibition. We propose an evolutionary
multi-objective algorithm (EMOA) to design potential protease inhibitors for
SARS-CoV-2's main protease. Based on the SELFIES representation the EMOA
maximizes the binding of candidate ligands to the protein using the docking
tool QuickVina 2, while at the same time taking into account further objectives
like drug-likeliness or the fulfillment of filter constraints. The experimental
part analyzes the evolutionary process and discusses the inhibitor candidates.

    <title>The First French COVID19 Lockdown Twitter Dataset</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present a mainly French coronavirus Twitter dataset that we
have been continuously collecting since lockdown restrictions have been enacted
in France (in March 17, 2020). We offer our datasets and sentiment analysis
annotations to the research community at
https://github.com/calciu/COVID19-LockdownFr. They have been obtained using
high performance computing (HPC) capabilities of our university's datacenter.
We think that our contribution can facilitate analysis of online conversation
dynamics reflecting people sentiments when facing severe home confinement
restrictions determined by the outbreak of this world wide epidemic. We hope
that our contribution will help decode shared experience and mood but also test
the sensitivity of sentiment measurement instruments and incite the development
of new instruments, methods and approaches.

    <title>Towards Seamless Authentication for Zoom-Based Online Teaching and
  Meeting</title>
    <summary>  The lockdowns and travel restrictions in current coronavirus pandemic
situation has replaced face-to-face teaching and meeting with online teaching
and meeting. Recently, the video conferencing tool Zoom has become extremely
popular for its simple-to-use feature and low network bandwith requirement.
However, Zoom has serious security and privacy issues. Due to weak
authentication mechanisms, unauthorized persons are invading Zoom sessions and
creating disturbances (known as Zoom bombing). In this paper, we propose a
preliminary work towards a seamless authentication mechanism for Zoom-based
teaching and meeting. Our method is based on PRNU (Photo Response Non
Uniformity)-based camera authentication, which can authenticate the camera of a
device used in a Zoom meeting without requiring any assistance from the
participants (e.g., needing the participant to provide biometric). Results from
a small-scale experiment validates the proposed method.

    <title>A small molecule drug candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease</title>
    <summary>  A new coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought the world to a
state of crisis, causing a major pandemic, claiming more than 433,000 lives and
instigating major financial damage to the global economy. Despite current
efforts, developing safe and effective treatments remains a major challenge.
Moreover, new strains of the virus are likely to emerge in the future. To
prevent future pandemics, several drugs with various mechanisms of action are
required. Drug discovery efforts against the virus fall into two main
categories: (a) monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the virus
and blocking it from entry; (b) small molecule inhibitors targeting key
proteins of the virus, interfering with replication and translation of the
virus. In this study, we are presenting a computational investigation of a
potential drug candidate that targets SARS-CoV-2 protease, a viral protein
critical for replication and translation of the virus.

    <title>Effective immunity and second waves: a dynamic causal modelling study</title>
    <summary>  This technical report addresses a pressing issue in the trajectory of the
coronavirus outbreak; namely, the rate at which effective immunity is lost
following the first wave of the pandemic. This is a crucial epidemiological
parameter that speaks to both the consequences of relaxing lockdown and the
propensity for a second wave of infections. Using a dynamic causal model of
reported cases and deaths from multiple countries, we evaluated the evidence
models of progressively longer periods of immunity. The results speak to an
effective population immunity of about three months that, under the model,
defers any second wave for approximately six months in most countries. This may
have implications for the window of opportunity for tracking and tracing, as
well as for developing vaccination programmes, and other therapeutic
interventions.

    <title>Exploring the Effect of 2019-nCoV Containment Policies on Crime: The
  Case of Los Angeles</title>
    <summary>  The global spread of 2019-nCoV, a new virus belonging to the coronavirus
family, forced national and local governments to apply different sets of
measures aimed at containing its outbreak. Los Angeles has been one of the
first cities in the United States to declare the state of emergency on March
4th, progressively issuing stronger policies involving--among the
others--social distancing, the prohibition of crowded private and public
gatherings and closure of leisure premises. These interventions highly disrupt
and modify daily activities and habits, urban mobility and micro-level
interactions between citizens. One of the many social phenomena that could be
influenced by such measures is crime. Exploiting public data on crime in Los
Angeles, and relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime, this
work investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an
impact on crime trends in a metropolis using Bayesian structural time-series
(BSTS) models. The article specifically focuses on nine urban crime categories,
daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 28th 2020. The analyses have
been updated bi-weekly (up to March 16\ts{th} and up to March 28\ts{th} 2020)
to dynamically assess the short-term effects of mild and hard interventions to
shed light on how crime adapts to such structural modification of the
environment. The results show that overall crime in Las Angeles is
significantly decreasing, as well as robbery, shoplifting, theft and battery.
No significant effect has been found for stolen vehicle, burglary, assault with
deadly weapon, intimate partner violence and homicide. In the last section of
this article, policy implications are also discussed.

    <title>Sex Differences in Severity and Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19:
  Evidence from Pooled Literature Analysis and Insights from Integrated
  Bioinformatic Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of current studies that examined sex
differences in severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and identify
potential mechanisms underpinning these differences. Methods: We performed a
systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining
associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web
of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data
were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary
data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion
criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men
were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with
women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group
compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for
male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of
ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based
immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is
positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly
regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an
increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,
which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular
compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell
receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified
as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in
men.

    <title>Framing COVID-19: How we conceptualize and discuss the pandemic on
  Twitter</title>
    <summary>  Doctors and nurses in these weeks are busy in the trenches, fighting against
a new invisible enemy: Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are
besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related
terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and
diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of
war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also
in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present
an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets
posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first
analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show
that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus
treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the
population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to
three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal
frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal
frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR
is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one.
However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around
many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line
with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu,
may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the
Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in
the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current
pandemic.

    <title>An epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19: A South African
  case study</title>
    <summary>  An epidemiological model is developed for the spread of COVID-19 in South
Africa. A variant of the classical compartmental SEIR model, called the SEIQRDP
model, is used. As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global
COVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the
SEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South
Korea - countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their
peaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number
of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by
when. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then
used to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the
initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability
of the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently
recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values.
The resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be
reasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the
number of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October
2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to
90,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are
heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence
to these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly
sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The
future aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South
African SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying
lockdown levels proposed by the South African Government.

    <title>Social confinement and mesoscopic localization of epidemics on networks</title>
    <summary>  Messaging around COVID-19 has focused on individual behavior while event
cancellations are decided on a case-by-case basis with limited information.
Unfortunately, most models assume random mixing patterns instead of the
higher-order structures necessary to describe large events. We present a
higher-order description of epidemics in networks and find mesoscopic
localization where spreading can concentrate around key substructures. We
discuss the implications of this result and model the impact of a blanket
cancellation of events larger than a critical size. We find that epidemics in a
localized phase can suddenly collapse when interventions operate over
structures rather than individuals.

    <title>Laser Spectroscopic Technique for Direct Identification of a Single
  Virus I: FASTER CARS</title>
    <summary>  From the famous 1918 H1N1 influenza to the present COVID-19 pandemic, the
need for improved virial detection techniques is all too apparent. The aim of
the present paper is to show that identification of individual virus particles
in clinical sample materials quickly and reliably is near at hand. First of
all, our team has developed techniques for identification of virions based on a
modular atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, Femtosecond Adaptive
Spectroscopic Techniques with Enhanced Resolution via Coherent Anti-Stokes
Raman Scattering (FASTER CARS) [1] using tip-enhanced techniques markedly
improves the sensitivity.

    <title>A Poisson Kalman filter for disease surveillance</title>
    <summary>  An optimal filter for Poisson observations is developed as a variant of the
traditional Kalman filter. Poisson distributions are characteristic of
infectious diseases, which model the number of patients recorded as presenting
each day to a health care system. We develop both a linear and nonlinear
(extended) filter. The methods are applied to a case study of neonatal sepsis
and postinfectious hydrocephalus in Africa, using parameters estimated from
publicly available data. Our approach is applicable to a broad range of disease
dynamics, including both noncommunicable and the inherent nonlinearities of
communicable infectious diseases and epidemics such as from COVID-19.

    <title>Social distancing versus early detection and contacts tracing in
  epidemic management</title>
    <summary>  Different countries -- and sometimes different regions within the same
countries -- have adopted different strategies in trying to contain the ongoing
COVID-19 epidemic; these mix in variable parts social confinement, early
detection and contact tracing. In this paper we discuss the different effects
of these ingredients on the epidemic dynamics; the discussion is conducted with
the help of two simple models, i.e. the classical SIR model and the recently
introduced variant (A-SIR, arXiv:2003.08720) which takes into account the
presence of a large set of asymptomatic infectives.

    <title>A Fully Distributed, Privacy Respecting Approach for Back-tracking of
  Potentially Infectious Contacts</title>
    <summary>  In limiting the rapid spread of highly infectious diseases like Covid-19
means to immediately identify individuals who had been in contact with a newly
diagnosed infected person have proven to be important. Such potential victims
can go into quarantine until tested thus constraining further spread. This note
describes a concept of mobile device (e.g. Smart phones) based approach for
tracking interpersonal contacts which might have led to infection and alerting
the potential victims. The approach assures means for defense against malicious
usage while assuring a high level of privacy for all people involved.

    <title>Attempting to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2: Associations between
  the number of cases in regions and selected economic and geographic
  parameters</title>
    <summary>  We present in this work some results from analysing the spread of Covid-19 in
different countries and regions around the world and the potential relations
with climate, geographical location, and GDP. While the situation remains
dynamic, we believe this analysis has the potential to uncover certain
underlying trends. We primarily intend the results to drive further, more
detailed analysis of the relevant data by other researchers that would help us
gather a better understanding of the situation, aiding our preparedness. Our
observations show that countries in high latitudes, with temperate and/or
continental climate, and with reasonably "open" economies are the most
vulnerable to this outbreak.

    <title>TraceSecure: Towards Privacy Preserving Contact Tracing</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing is being widely employed to combat the spread of COVID-19.
Many apps have been developed that allow for tracing to be done automatically
based off location and interaction data generated by users. There are concerns,
however, regarding the privacy and security of users data when using these
apps. These concerns are paramount for users who contract the virus, as they
are generally required to release all their data. Motivated by the need to
protect users privacy we propose two solutions to this problem. Our first
solution builds on current "message based" methods and our second leverages
ideas from secret sharing and additively homomorphic encryption.

    <title>Simple Formulas for a Two-Tier Strategy to Flatten the Curve</title>
    <summary>  Some basic facts that enable or constrain efforts to "flatten the curve" by
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are summarized and placed in the current
context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Analytical formulas are presented for a
simple two-tier NPI strategy that places different social distancing targets
for high- and low-risk groups. The results aim to facilitate rapid what-if
analysis rather than replace detailed simulation, which remains indispensable
for informed decision making. The appearance of the oft neglected Lambert
function in the resulting formulas is noted.

    <title>A simple statistical physics model for the epidemic with incubation
  period</title>
    <summary>  Based on the classical SIR model, we derive a simple modification for the
dynamics of epidemics with a known incubation period of infection. The model is
described by a system of integro-differential equations. Parameters of our
model directly related to epidemiological data. We derive some analytical
results, as well as perform numerical simulations. We use the proposed model to
analyze COVID-19 epidemic data in Armenia. We propose a strategy: organize a
quarantine, and then conduct extensive testing of risk groups during the
quarantine, evaluating the percentage of the population among risk groups and
people with symptoms.

    <title>Momentum managing epidemic spread and Bessel functions</title>
    <summary>  Starting with the power law for the total number of infections during the
middle stages of epidemics, we propose differential equations describing the
process of momentum epidemic management, which is a set of measures aimed at
reducing the epidemic spread via timely response to the dynamic of the number
of infections. In the most aggressive mode, the saturation of the number of
infections can be achieved sufficiently quickly. Our 2-phase formula matches
very well the total numbers of infections for Covid-19 in many countries;
modeling the first phase is based on Bessel functions. We discuss Austria,
Germany, Japan, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and
the USA.

    <title>Epidemic control via stochastic optimal control</title>
    <summary>  We study the problem of optimal control of the stochastic SIR model. Models
of this type are used in mathematical epidemiology to capture the time
evolution of highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Our approach relies
on reformulating the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation as a stochastic minimum
principle. This results in a system of forward backward stochastic differential
equations, which is amenable to numerical solution via Monte Carlo simulations.
We present a number of numerical solutions of the system under a variety of
scenarios.

    <title>Reconfiguring and ramping-up ventilator production in the face of
  COVID-19: Can robots help?</title>
    <summary>  As the COVID-19 pandemic expands, the shortening of medical equipment is
swelling. A key piece of equipment getting far-out attention has been
ventilators. The difference between supply and demand is substantial to be
handled with normal production techniques, especially under social distancing
measures in place. The study explores the rationale of human-robot teams to
ramp up production using advantages of both the ease of integration and
maintaining social distancing. The paper presents a model for faster
integration of collaborative robots and design guidelines for workstation. The
scenarios are evaluated for an open source ventilator through continuous
human-robot simulation and amplification of results in a discrete event
simulation.

    <title>Detection and Estimation of Local Signals</title>
    <summary>  We study the maximum score statistic to detect and estimate local signals in
the form of change-points in the level, slope, or other property of a sequence
of observations, and to segment the sequence when there appear to be multiple
changes. We find that when observations are serially dependent, the
change-points can lead to upwardly biased estimates of autocorrelations,
resulting in a sometimes serious loss of power. Examples involving temperature
variations, the level of atmospheric greenhouse gases, suicide rates and daily
incidence of COVID-19 illustrate the general theory.

    <title>How Much Income Inequality Is Too Much?</title>
    <summary>  We propose a highly schematic economic model in which, in some cases, wage
inequalities lead to higher overall social welfare. This is due to the fact
that high earners can consume low productivity, non essential products, which
allows everybody to remain employed even when the productivity of essential
goods is high and producing them does not require everybody to work. We derive
a relation between heterogeneities in technologies and the minimum Gini
coefficient required to maximize global welfare. Stronger inequalities appear
to be economically unjustified. Our model may shed light on the role of
non-essential goods in the economy, a topical issue when thinking about the
post-Covid-19 world.

    <title>Risk Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission from Bluetooth Low Energy
  Measurements</title>
    <summary>  Digital contact tracing approaches based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) have
the potential to efficiently contain and delay outbreaks of infectious diseases
such as the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this work we propose a novel
machine learning based approach to reliably detect subjects that have spent
enough time in close proximity to be at risk of being infected. Our study is an
important proof of concept that will aid the battery of epidemiological
policies aiming to slow down the rapid spread of COVID-19.

    <title>Agent-Level Pandemic Simulation (ALPS) for Analyzing Effects of Lockdown
  Measures</title>
    <summary>  This paper develops an agent-level simulation model, termed ALPS, for
simulating the spread of an infectious disease in a confined community. The
mechanism of transmission is agent-to-agent contact, using parameters reported
for Corona COVID-19 pandemic. The main goal of the ALPS simulation is analyze
effects of preventive measures -- imposition and lifting of lockdown norms --
on the rates of infections, fatalities and recoveries. The model assumptions
and choices represent a balance between competing demands of being realistic
and being efficient for real-time inferences. The model provides quantification
of gains in reducing casualties by imposition and maintenance of restrictive
measures in place.

    <title>Size and timescale of epidemics in the SIR framework</title>
    <summary>  The most important features to assess the severity of an epidemic are its
size and its timescale. We discuss these features in a systematic way in the
context of SIR and SIR-type models. We investigate in detail how the size and
timescale of the epidemic can be changed by acting on the parameters
characterizing the model. Using these results and having as guideline the
COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, we compare the efficiency of different containment
strategies for contrasting an epidemic diffusion such as social distancing,
lockdown, tracing, early detection and isolation.

    <summary>  This paper aims at analyzing the effect on the US air transportation system
of the travel restriction measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic
from a passenger perspective. Flight centric data are not already publicly and
widely available therefore the traditional metrics used to measure the state of
this system are not yet available. Seven metrics based on three different
passenger-generated datasets are proposed here. They aim to measure in close to
real-time how the travel restriction measures impacted the relation between
major stakeholders of the US air transportation system, namely passengers,
airports and airlines.

    <title>Balancing Personal Privacy and Public Safety in COVID-19: Case of Korea

    <summary>  There has been vigorous debate on how different countries responded to the
COVID-19. To secure public safety, Korea has actively used personal information
at the risk of personal privacy whereas France encourages voluntary cooperation
at the risk of public safety. In this article, we examine the pros and cons of
these two different approaches in epidemiological investigations. In addition,
we present technological options of de-identification of personal information
in the course of managing this pandemic under control. We discuss lessons for
future research and policy implications.

    <title>Two-level modeling of quarantine</title>
    <summary>  Continuum models of epidemics do not take into account the underlying
microscopic network structure of social connections. This drawback becomes
extreme during quarantine when most people dramatically decrease their number
of social interactions, while others (like cashiers in grocery stores) continue
maintaining hundreds of contacts per day. We formulate a two-level model of
quarantine. On a microscopic level, we model a single neighborhood assuming a
star-network structure. On a mesoscopic level, the neighborhoods are placed on
a two-dimensional lattice with nearest neighbors interactions. The modeling
results are compared with the COVID-19 data for several counties in Michigan

    <title>How to manage the post pandemic opening? A Pontryagin Maximum Principle
  approach</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has completely disrupted the operation of our
societies. Its elusive transmission process, characterized by an unusually long
incubation period, as well as a high contagion capacity, has forced many
countries to take quarantine and social isolation measures that conspire
against the performance of national economies. This situation confronts
decision makers in different countries with the alternative of reopening the
economies, thus facing the unpredictable cost of a rebound of the infection.
This work tries to offer an initial theoretical framework to handle this
alternative.

    <title>Spatial Modeling of COVID-19: Greece and Andalusia as Case Examples</title>
    <summary>  We examine the spatial modeling of the outbreak of COVID-19 in two regions:
the country of Greece and the autonomous community of Andalusia in Spain. We
start with an ODE version of a SEIHARD model that we optimize to obtain
relevant parameters for these regions. Subsequently, spatially distributed
versions of the corresponding models in the form of
convection-reaction-diffusion equations are considered. We show that these
models bear significant potential towards capturing the spatial expansion of
the pandemic and veins of future work are considered to that effect.

    <title>Crackovid: Optimizing Group Testing</title>
    <summary>  We study the problem usually referred to as group testing in the context of
COVID-19. Given $n$ samples taken from patients, how should we select mixtures
of samples to be tested, so as to maximize information and minimize the number
of tests? We consider both adaptive and non-adaptive strategies, and take a
Bayesian approach with a prior both for infection of patients and test errors.
We start by proposing a mathematically principled objective, grounded in
information theory. We then optimize non-adaptive optimization strategies using
genetic algorithms, and leverage the mathematical framework of adaptive
sub-modularity to obtain theoretical guarantees for the greedy-adaptive method.

    <title>ECIR 2020 Workshops: Assessing the Impact of Going Online</title>
    <summary>  ECIR 2020 https://ecir2020.org/ was one of the many conferences affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic. The Conference Chairs decided to keep the initially
planned dates (April 14-17, 2020) and move to a fully online event. In this
report, we describe the experience of organizing the ECIR 2020 Workshops in
this scenario from two perspectives: the workshop organizers and the workshop
participants. We provide a report on the organizational aspect of these events
and the consequences for participants. Covering the scientific dimension of
each workshop is outside the scope of this article.

    <title>Crowd Control in Plazas Constrained to Social Distancing</title>
    <summary>  We present a simple and versatile method for calculating the maximum capacity
of public spaces constrained to social distancing, following the recommended
measures of the WHO due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This method assumes
a minimum required distance of two meters between persons and is tested in four
actual plazas. Additionally, we estimate public space capacity in case of
public events, such as markets or concerts. We believe our method will directly
provide guidelines for crowd control in the so-called "new normality", serving
as a first step for future and more accurate developments.

    <title>A socio-technical framework for digital contact tracing</title>
    <summary>  In their efforts to tackle the COVID-19 crisis, decision makers are
considering the development and use of smartphone applications for contact
tracing. Even though these applications differ in technology and methods, there
is an increasing concern about their implications for privacy and human rights.
Here we propose a framework to evaluate their suitability in terms of impact on
the users, employed technology and governance methods. We illustrate its usage
with three applications, and with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)
guidelines, highlighting their limitations.

    <title>PeopleTraffic: a common framework for harmonizing privacy and epidemic
  risks</title>
    <summary>  PeopleTraffic is a proposed initiative to develop a real-time, open-data
population density mapping tool open to public institutions, private companies
and the civil society, providing a common framework for infection spreading
prevention. The system is based on a real-time people' locations gathering and
mapping system from available 2G, 3G and 4G mobile networks operators,
enforcing privacy-by-design through the adoption of an innovative data
anonymizing algorithm inspired by quantum information de-localizing processes.
Besides being originally targeted to help balancing social distancing
regulations during the Phase-2 of the COVID-19 pandemics, PeopleTraffic would
be beneficial for any infection spreading prevention event, e.g. supporting
policy-makers in strategic decision-making.

    <summary>  This report presents an analysis of #hashtags used by Italian Cultural
Heritage institutions to promote and communicate cultural content during the
COVID-19 lock-down period in Italy. Several activities to support and engage
users' have been proposed using social media. Most of these activities present
one or more #hashtags which help to aggregate content and create a community on
specific topics. Results show that on one side Italian institutions have been
very proactive in adapting to the pandemic scenario and on the other side
users' reacted very positively increasing their participation in the proposed
activities.

    <title>Can Efficient Detection and Isolation Control an Epidemic?</title>
    <summary>  The World Health Organisation (WHO) has very strongly recommended testing and
isolation as a strategy for controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The goal
of this paper is to quantify the effects of detection and isolation in formal
models of epidemics of varying complexity. A key parameter of such models is
the basic reproduction ratio. We show that an effective detection and isolation
strategy leads to a reduction of the basic reproduction ratio and can even lead
to this ratio becoming lower than one.

best; and (iii) their limitations and the reasons for why they "break" during
extreme market events. An accompanying appendix (with a link to freely
accessible source code) includes backtests for various strategies, which put
flesh on and illustrate the discussion in the main text.

    <title>Analytic solution of the SEIR epidemic model via asymptotic approximant</title>
    <summary>  An analytic solution is obtained to the SEIR Epidemic Model. The solution is
created by constructing a single second-order nonlinear differential equation
in ln(S) and analytically continuing its divergent power series solution such
that it matches the correct long-time exponential damping of the epidemic
model. This is achieved through an asymptotic approximant (Barlow et. al, 2017,
Q. Jl Mech. Appl. Math, 70 (1), 21-48) in the form of a modified symmetric Pade
approximant that incorporates this damping. The utility of the analytical form
is demonstrated through its application to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Figure of Merit for Dark Energy Constraints from Current Observational
  Data</title>
    <summary>  Choosing the appropriate figure of merit (FoM) for dark energy (DE)
constraints is key in comparing different DE experiments. Here we show that for
a set of DE parameters {f_i}, it is most intuitive to define FoM =
1/\sqrt{Cov(f1,f2,f3,...)}, where Cov(f1,f2,f3,...) is the covariance matrix of
{f_i}. The {f_i} should be minimally correlated. We demonstrate two useful
choices of {f_i} using 182 SNe Ia (compiled by Riess et al. 2007), [R(z_*),
l_a(z_*), \Omega_b h^2] from the five year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) observations, and SDSS measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) scale, assuming the HST prior of H_0=72+/-8 km/s Mpc^{-1} and without
assuming spatial flatness. We find that the correlation of (w_0,w_{0.5})
[w_0=w_X(z=0), w_{0.5}=w_X(z=0.5), w_X(a) = 3w_{0.5}-2w_0+3(w_0-w_{0.5})a] is
significantly smaller than that of (w_0,w_a) [w_X(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a]. In order to
obtain model-independent constraints on DE, we parametrize the DE density
function X(z)=\rho_X(z)/\rho_X(0) as a free function with X_{0.5}, X_{1.0}, and
X_{1.5} [values of X(z) at z=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5] as free parameters estimated
from data. If one assumes a linear DE equation of state, current data are
consistent with a cosmological constant at 68% C.L. If one assumes X(z) to be a
free function parametrized by (X_{0.5}, X_{1.0}, X_{1.5}), current data deviate
from a cosmological constant at z=1 at 68% C.L., but are consistent with a
cosmological constant at 95% C.L.. Future DE experiments will allow us to
dramatically increase the FoM of constraints on (w_0,w_{0.5}) and of (X_{0.5},
X_{1.0}, X_{1.5}). This will significantly shrink the DE parameter space to
enable the discovery of DE evolution, or the conclusive evidence for a
cosmological constant.

    <title>The potential of X-ray cluster surveys to constrain primordial
  non-Gaussianity</title>
    <summary>  We present forecasts for constraints on deviations from Gaussian distribution
of primordial density perturbations from future X-ray surveys of galaxy
clusters. Our analysis is based on computing the Fisher-Matrix for number
counts and large-scale power spectrum of clusters. We consider a survey with
high-sensitivity and wide-area to detect about 2.5 x 10^5 extended sources.
Based on the self-calibration approach, and including Planck priors in our
analysis, we constrain 9 cosmological parameters and 4 nuisance parameters,
which define the relation between cluster mass and X-ray flux. Because of the
scale dependence of large-scale bias induced by local-shape non-Gaussianity, we
find that the power spectrum provides strong constraints on the non-Gaussianity
f_nl parameter, which complement the stringent constraints on the power
spectrum normalization, \sigma_8, from the number counts. To quantify the joint
constraints on theese two parameters, that specify the timing of structure
formation for a fixed background expansion, we define the figure-of-merit
FoM_SFT = (det[Cov(sigma_8,f_nl)])^{-1/2}. We find that our surveys constrain
deviations from Gaussianity with a precision of \Delta f_nl~10 at 1 \sigma
confidence level, with FoM_SFT~39. We point out that constraints on f_nl are
weakly sensitive to the uncertainties in the knowledge of nuisance parameters.
As an application of non-Gaussian constraints from available data, we analyse
the impact of positive skewness on the occurrence of XMMU-J2235, a massive
distant cluster discovered at z~1.4. We confirm that in a WMAP-7 Gaussian
Lambda CDM cosmology, within the survey volume, ~5x10^{-3} objects like this
are expected to be found: to increase this probability by a factor of at least
10, one needs to evade either the available constraints on f_nl or sigma_8.

    <title>Domain-Constrained Advertising Keyword Generation</title>
    <summary>  Advertising (ad for short) keyword suggestion is important for sponsored
search to improve online advertising and increase search revenue. There are two
common challenges in this task. First, the keyword bidding problem: hot ad
keywords are very expensive for most of the advertisers because more
advertisers are bidding on more popular keywords, while unpopular keywords are
difficult to discover. As a result, most ads have few chances to be presented
to the users. Second, the inefficient ad impression issue: a large proportion
of search queries, which are unpopular yet relevant to many ad keywords, have
no ads presented on their search result pages. Existing retrieval-based or
matching-based methods either deteriorate the bidding competition or are unable
to suggest novel keywords to cover more queries, which leads to inefficient ad
impressions. To address the above issues, this work investigates to use
generative neural networks for keyword generation in sponsored search. Given a
purchased keyword (a word sequence) as input, our model can generate a set of
keywords that are not only relevant to the input but also satisfy the domain
constraint which enforces that the domain category of a generated keyword is as
expected. Furthermore, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to
adaptively utilize domain-specific information in keyword generation. Offline
evaluation shows that the proposed model can generate keywords that are
diverse, novel, relevant to the source keyword, and accordant with the domain
constraint. Online evaluation shows that generative models can improve coverage
(COV), click-through rate (CTR), and revenue per mille (RPM) substantially in
sponsored search.

    <title>A simple SIR model with a large set of asymptomatic infectives</title>
    <summary>  There is increasing evidence that one of the most difficult problems in
trying to control the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic is the presence of a large
cohort of asymptomatic infectives. We develop a SIR-type model taking into
account the presence of asymptomatic, or however undetected, infective, and the
substantially long time these spend being infective and not isolated. We
discuss how a SIR-based prediction of the epidemic course based on early data
but not taking into account the presence of a large set of asymptomatic
infectives would give wrong estimate of very relevant quantities such as the
need of hospital beds, the time to the epidemic peak, and the number of people
which are left untouched by the first wave and thus in danger in case of a
second epidemic wave. In the second part of the note, we apply our model to the
COVID-19 epidemics in Italy. We obtain a good agreement with epidemiological
data; according to the best fit of epidemiological data in terms of this model,
only 10\% of infectives in Italy is symptomatic.

    <title>A simplified model for expected development of the SARS-CoV-2 (Corona)
  spread in Germany and US after social distancing</title>
    <summary>  Widespread opinions and discussion exist regarding the efficiency of social
distancing after crucial spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the actual
Covid-19 pandemic. While Germany has released a federal law that prohibits any
type of direct contact for more than 2 people other countries including the US
released curfews.
  People are now wondering whether these measures are helpful to stop or hamper
the Covid-19 pandemic and to limit the spread of the new corona virus.
  A quantitative statement on this question depends on many parameters that are
difficult to grasp mathematically and cannot therefore be made conclusively
(they include consistent adherence to the measures decided, the estimated
number of unreported cases, the possible limitation by test capacities,
possible mutations of the virus, etc ...). However, it turns out that a
reduction in the actual daily new infection rate (actual daily growth rate of
reported cases, in short: infection rate) from the current value of 30-35% in
the US to 10% would be extremely effective in stopping the spread of the virus.
The severe restrictions in Germany which closed any public events, schools and
universities a week ago might already have contributed to a reduction of the
growth rate of reported cases below 30%.

    <title>Automated Methods for Detection and Classification Pneumonia based on
  X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning</title>
    <summary>  Recently, researchers, specialists, and companies around the world are
rolling out deep learning and image processing-based systems that can fastly
process hundreds of X-Ray and computed tomography (CT) images to accelerate the
diagnosis of pneumonia such as SARS, COVID-19, and aid in its containment.
Medical images analysis is one of the most promising research areas, it
provides facilities for diagnosis and making decisions of a number of diseases
such as MERS, COVID-19. In this paper, we present a comparison of recent Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures for automatic binary
classification of pneumonia images based fined tuned versions of (VGG16, VGG19,
DenseNet201, Inception_ResNet_V2, Inception_V3, Resnet50, MobileNet_V2 and
Xception). The proposed work has been tested using chest X-Ray &amp; CT dataset
which contains 5856 images (4273 pneumonia and 1583 normal). As result we can
conclude that fine-tuned version of Resnet50, MobileNet_V2 and
Inception_Resnet_V2 show highly satisfactory performance with rate of increase
in training and validation accuracy (more than 96% of accuracy). Unlike CNN,
Xception, VGG16, VGG19, Inception_V3 and DenseNet201 display low performance
(more than 84% accuracy).

    <title>Portable Health Screening Device of Respiratory Infections</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 epidemic was listed as a public health emergency of
international concern by the WHO on January 30, 2020. To curb the secondary
spread of the epidemic, many public places were equipped with thermal imagers
to check the body temperature. However, the COVID-19 pneumonia has concealed
symptoms: the first symptom may not be fever, and can be shortness of breath.
During epidemic prevention, many people tend to wear masks. Therefore, in this
demo paper, we proposed a portable non-contact healthy screening system for
people wearing masks, which can simultaneously obtain body temperature and
respiration state. This system consists of three modules viz. thermal image
collection module, health indicator calculation module and health assessment
module. In this system, the thermal video of human faces is first captured
through a portable thermal imaging camera. Then, body temperature and
respiration state are extracted from the video and are imported into the
following health assessment module. Finally, the screening result can be
obtained. The results of preliminary experiments show that this syetem can give
an accurate screening result within 15 seconds. This system can be applied to
many application scenarios such as community and campus.

    <title>Prediction of potential inhibitors for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of
  SARS-CoV-2 using comprehensive drug repurposing and molecular docking
  approach</title>
    <summary>  The pandemic prevalence of COVID-19 has become a very serious global health
issue. Scientists all over the world have been heavily invested in the
discovery of a drug to combat SARS-CoV-2. It has been found that RNA-dependent
RNA Polymerase (RdRp) plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus
could be a potential drug target. Here, comprehensive computational approaches
including drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to predict an
effective drug candidate targeting RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. This study revealed that
Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin,
7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'-guanosine and Ivermectin have a potential
inhibitory interaction with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, and could be effective drugs
for COVID-19. In addition, virtual screening of the compounds from ZINC
database also allowed the prediction of two compounds (ZINC09128258 and ZINC
09883305) with pharmacophore features that interact effectively with RdRp of
SARS-CoV-2; indicating their potentiality as effective inhibitors of the
enzyme. Furthermore, ADME analysis along with analysis of toxicity was also
investigated to check the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of the
two compounds. Comparative structural analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes
revealed that positions of the amino acid Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138,
D140, T141, S709 and N781 are crucial for drug surface hotspot in the RdRp of
SARS-CoV-2.

    <title>Why integral equations should be used instead of differential equations
  to describe the dynamics of epidemics</title>
    <summary>  It is of vital importance to understand and track the dynamics of rapidly
unfolding epidemics. The health and economic consequences of the current
COVID-19 pandemic provide a poignant case. Here we point out that since they
are based on differential equations, the most widely used models of epidemic
spread are plagued by an approximation that is not justified in the case of the
current COVID-19 pandemic. Taking the example of data from New York City, we
show that currently used models significantly underestimate the initial basic
reproduction number ($R_0$). The correct description, based on integral
equations, can be implemented in most of the reported models and it much more
accurately accounts for the dynamics of the epidemic after sharp changes in
$R_0$ due to restrictive public congregation measures. It also provides a novel
way to determine the incubation period, and most importantly, as we demonstrate
for several countries, this method allows an accurate monitoring of $R_0$ and
thus a fine-tuning of any restrictive measures. Integral equation based models
do not only provide the conceptually correct description, they also have more
predictive power than differential equation based models, therefore we do not
see any reason for using the latter.

    <title>Contact rate epidemic control of COVID-19: an equilibrium view</title>
    <summary>  We consider the control of the COVID-19 pandemic through a standard SIR
compartmental model. This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals'
decisions to limit their social interactions: when the epidemic is ongoing, an
individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting
infected, but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers
his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster, but the effort cost may be
high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed,
resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove
theoretically that equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. However, this
equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal
optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning
that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples
and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a SEIR compartmental
model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease.
In all the scenarii considered, the divergence between the individual and
societal strategies happens both before the peak of the epidemic, due to
individuals' fears, and after, when a significant propagation is still
underway.

    <title>A Semiempirical Dynamical Model to Forecast the Propagation of
  Epidemics: The Case of the Sars-Cov-2 in Spain</title>
    <summary>  A semiempirical model, based in the logistic map, has been succesfully
applied to forecast important quantities along the several phases of the
outbreak of the covid-19 for different countries. This paper shows how the
model was calibrated and applied to perform predictions of people needing to be
hospitalized, needs of ventilators, or the number of deaths which would be
produced. It is shown specifically the results obtained in the case of Spain,
showing a prediction of diagnosed infected and deaths which will be observed
after the ease of the total lockdown produced the 13th of March. Is also shown
how this model can provide an insight of what the level of infection in the
different regions of Spain is forecasted. The model predicts for Spain for the
end of May more than 400,000 diagnosed infected cases, number which will be
probably higher due to the change in the possibilities of performing massive
number of tests to the general population. The number of forecasted deaths for
that date is 46,000 +/- 15,000. The model also predicts the level of infection
at the different Spanish regions, providing a counterintuitive result in the
cases of Madrid and Catalonia as the result shows a higher the level of
infection at Catalonia than the level at Madrid, according with this model. All
of these results can be used to guide policy makers in order to optimize
resources and to avoid future outbreaks of the covid-19.

that are affected by COVID-19 from March 01, 2020 to April 17, 2020. We study
the data in the framework of time series network data. The networks are defined
by using the geodesic distances of the districts or cities specified by the
latitude and longitude coordinates. We particularly restrict our analysis to
all but districts in the north-eastern part of India. Unlike recent studies on
the projection of the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the near
future, in this note, the emphasis is on understanding the dynamics of the
spread of the virus across the districts of India. We perform spectral and
structural analysis of the model networks by considering several measures,
notably the spectral radius, the algebraic connectivity, the average clustering
coefficient, the average path length and the structure of the communities.
Furthermore, we study the overall expansion properties given by the number of
districts or cities before and after lockdown. These studies show that lockdown
has a significant impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in districts or cities
over long distances. However, this impact is only observed after approximately
two weeks of lockdown. We speculate that this happened due to the insufficient
number of tests for COVID-19 before the lockdown which could not stop the
movement of people infected with the virus but not detected, over long
distances.

    <title>A dynamic modeling tool for estimating healthcare demand from the
  COVID19 epidemic and evaluating population-wide interventions</title>
    <summary>  Objectives. Public health officials need tools to assist with anticipating
the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We built
a modeling tool to aid practicing public health officials with estimating
healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the
potential impacts of population-wide social-distancing interventions. Methods.
The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the local spread of the
pandemic. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select
intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections
and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and
critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate
the tool using data from three regions of Chile. Results. Our scenarios
indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by
June, peaking in July or August at 6 to 50 times the current supply of beds and
ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home
quarantine, social distancing of individuals greater than 70 years, and
telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity. Conclusions.
Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from
COVID-19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy
scenarios and updating of results as new data become available.

    <title>When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and
  Saving the Economy</title>
    <summary>  The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to
fight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,
strongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In
this paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19
pandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are
helping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,
enabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and
conferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the
pandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss
the challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and
misinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication
technologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of
industries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at
risk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the
pandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.

    <title>The Fallibility of Contact-Tracing Apps</title>
    <summary>  Since the onset of the COVID-19's global spread we have been following the
debate around contact tracing apps -- the tech-enabled response to the
pandemic. As corporations, academics, governments, and civil society discuss
the right way to implement these apps, we noticed recurring implicit
assumptions. The proposed solutions are designed for a world where Internet
access and smartphone ownership are a given, people are willing and able to
install these apps, and those who receive notifications about potential
exposure to the virus have access to testing and can isolate safely. In this
work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough
smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight
a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the
elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially
distance. Unfortunately, these are also the groups that are at the highest
risks from COVID-19. We also report that the contact tracing apps that are
already deployed on an opt-in basis show disappointing adoption levels. We warn
about the potential consequences of over-extending the existing state and
corporate surveillance powers. Finally, we describe a multitude of scenarios
where contact tracing apps will not help regardless of access or policy. In
this work we call for a comprehensive and equitable policy response that
prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable, protects human rights, and
considers long term impact instead of focusing on technology-first fixes.

    <title>CoronaSurveys: Using Surveys with Indirect Reporting to Estimate the
  Incidence and Evolution of Epidemics</title>
    <summary>  The world is suffering from a pandemic called COVID-19, caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. National governments have problems evaluating the reach of
the epidemic, due to having limited resources and tests at their disposal. This
problem is especially acute in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hence,
any simple, cheap and flexible means of evaluating the incidence and evolution
of the epidemic in a given country with a reasonable level of accuracy is
useful. In this paper, we propose a technique based on (anonymous) surveys in
which participants report on the health status of their contacts. This indirect
reporting technique, known in the literature as network scale-up method,
preserves the privacy of the participants and their contacts, and collects
information from a larger fraction of the population (as compared to individual
surveys). This technique has been deployed in the CoronaSurveys project, which
has been collecting reports for the COVID-19 pandemic for more than two months.
Results obtained by CoronaSurveys show the power and flexibility of the
approach, suggesting that it could be an inexpensive and powerful tool for
LMICs.

    <title>Estimates of the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in Sweden</title>
    <summary>  In this paper a Bayesian SEIR model is studied to estimate the proportion of
the population infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. To
capture heterogeneity in the population and the effect of interventions to
reduce the rate of epidemic spread, the model uses a time-varying contact rate,
whose logarithm has a Gaussian process prior. A Poisson point process is used
to model the occurrence of deaths due to COVID-19 and the model is calibrated
using data of daily death counts in combination with a snapshot of the the
proportion of individuals with an active infection, performed in Stockholm in
late March. The methodology is applied to regions in Sweden. The results show
that the estimated proportion of the population who has been infected is around
13.5% in Stockholm, by 2020-05-15, and ranges between 2.5% - 15.6% in the other
investigated regions. In Stockholm where the peak of daily death counts is
likely behind us, parameter uncertainty does not heavily influence the expected
daily number of deaths, nor the expected cumulative number of deaths. It does,
however, impact the estimated cumulative number of infected individuals. In the
other regions, where random sampling of the number of active infections is not
available, parameter sharing is used to improve estimates, but the parameter
uncertainty remains substantial.

    <title>Mortality containment vs. economics opening: optimal policies in a
  SEIARD model</title>
    <summary>  We adapt a SEIRD differential model with asymptomatic population and Covid
deaths, which we call SEAIRD, to simulate the evolution of COVID-19, and add a
control function affecting both the diffusion of the virus and GDP, featuring
all direct and indirect containment policies; to model feasibility, the control
is assumed to be a piece-wise linear function satisfying additional
constraints. We describe the joint dynamics of infection and the economy and
discuss the trade-off between production and fatalities. In particular, we
carefully study the conditions for the existence of the optimal policy response
and its uniqueness. Uniqueness crucially depends on the marginal rate of
substitution between the statistical value of a human life and GDP; we show an
example with a phase transition: above a certain threshold, there is a unique
optimal containment policy; below the threshold, it is optimal to abstain from
any containment; and at the threshold itself there are two optimal policies. We
then explore and evaluate various profiles of various control policies
dependent on a small number of parameters.

    <title>A pandemic-resilient open-inquiry physical science lab course which
  leverages the Maker movement</title>
    <summary>  Without any major changes, a pilot version of a physical science lab course
was able to continue when the COVID-19 crisis necessitated the abrupt
suspension of on-campus education. The 'Maker Lab' course, in which students
conceive and set up their own experiments using affordable microcontrollers,
required students to follow the entire arc of the empirical research cycle
twice. The decision for and facilitation of such open-inquiry projects was
based on and warranted by the literature on teaching the process of
experimental research and the scientific method. The flipped classroom approach
was used, where contact time is devoted to discussions and the students' actual
experiments were carried out independently at home or elsewhere without the
supervision of an instructor. Despite the COVID-19 measures, all students were
able to produce interesting and successful research projects. While there were
of course difficulties encountered in the abrupt transition to online teaching,
we found several counterbalancing advantages that bear consideration for
inclusion even when all teaching activities can return to campus. We believe
that three components in the design of the course were vital to the resilience
of the course: the choice for fully open-inquiry projects, the decision to use
Arduinos as measurement tools, and the flipped aspect of the instruction
methods. We also include considerations for adapting these pandemic-resilient
methods in other courses and programs.

    <title>EPIC: An Epidemics Corpus Of Over 20 Million Relevant Tweets</title>
    <summary>  Since the start of COVID-19, several relevant corpora from various sources
are presented in the literature that contain millions of data points. While
these corpora are valuable in supporting many analyses on this specific
pandemic, researchers require additional benchmark corpora that contain other
epidemics to facilitate cross-epidemic pattern recognition and trend analysis
tasks. During our other efforts on COVID-19 related work, we discover very
little disease related corpora in the literature that are sizable and rich
enough to support such cross-epidemic analysis tasks. In this paper, we present
EPIC, a large-scale epidemic corpus that contains 20 millions micro-blog posts,
i.e., tweets crawled from Twitter, from year 2006 to 2020. EPIC contains a
subset of 17.8 millions tweets related to three general diseases, namely Ebola,
Cholera and Swine Flu, and another subset of 3.5 millions tweets of six global
epidemic outbreaks, including 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu, 2010 Haiti Cholera, 2012
Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), 2013 West African Ebola, 2016 Yemen
Cholera and 2018 Kivu Ebola. Furthermore, we explore and discuss the properties
of the corpus with statistics of key terms and hashtags and trends analysis for
each subset. Finally, we demonstrate the value and impact that EPIC could
create through a discussion of multiple use cases of cross-epidemic research
topics that attract growing interest in recent years. These use cases span
multiple research areas, such as epidemiological modeling, pattern recognition,
natural language understanding and economical modeling.

    <title>Femtomolar-level detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins using toroidal
  plasmonic metasensors</title>
    <summary>  Effective and efficient management of human betacoronavirus severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infection i.e., COVID-19 pandemic, required
sensitive sensors with short sample-to-result durations for performing
diagnostics. In this direction, one of appropriate alternative approach to
detect SARS-CoV-2 at low level (fmol) is exploring plasmonic metasensor
technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in
advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic
merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze
electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However,
the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a
typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed
using toroidal metasurface technology. This research reports fabrication of a
miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept
that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes
in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our
quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on
functionalized gold nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal
antibody of SARS-CoV-2 onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse
concentrations of the spike protein is monitored. Possessing molecular weight
around ~76 kDa allowed us to detect the presence of spike protein with
significantly low LoD ~4.2 fmol.

    <title>Measurement-Based Evaluation Of Google/Apple Exposure Notification API
  For Proximity Detection in a Commuter Bus</title>
    <summary>  We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus
in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API.
This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps.
Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of handset locations and are
publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API
need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a
complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment.
Changing the people holding a pair of handsets, with the location of the
handsets otherwise remaining unchanged, can cause variations of +/-10dB in the
attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss
Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus
measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered
despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for
at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification
rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an
exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the
exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by
distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak
dependence of detection rate on distance.

    <title>Digital Contact Tracing Using IP Colocation</title>
    <summary>  The spread of an infectious disease through a population can be modeled using
a network or a graph. In digital advertising, internet device graphs are graph
data sets that organize identifiers produced by mobile phones, PCs, TVs, and
tablets as they access media on the internet. Characterized by immense scale,
they have become ubiquitous as they enable targeted advertising, content
customization and tracking. This paper posits that internet device graphs, in
particular those based on IP colocation, can provide significant utility in
predicting and modeling the spread of infectious disease. Starting the week of
March 16th, 2020, in the United States, many individuals began to
`shelter-in-place' as schools and workplaces across the nation closed because
of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper quantifies the effect of the
shelter-in-place orders on a large scale internet device graph with more than a
billion nodes by studying the graph before and after orders went into effect.
The effects are clearly visible. The structure of the graph suggests behavior
least conducive to transmission of infection occurred in the US between April
12th and 19th, 2020. This paper also discusses the utility of device graphs for
i) contact tracing, ii) prediction of `hot spots', iii) simulation of
infectious disease spread, and iv) delivery of advertisement-based warnings to
potentially exposed individuals. The paper also posits an overarching question:
can systems and datasets amassed by entities in the digital ad ecosystem aid in
the fight against COVID-19?

    <title>Estimation of temporal covariances in pathogen dynamics using Bayesian
  multivariate autoregressive models</title>
    <summary>  It is well recognised that animal and plant pathogens form complex ecological
communities of interacting organisms within their hosts. Although community
ecology approaches have been applied to determine pathogen interactions at the
within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust inference of the
epidemiological impact of pathogen interactions are lacking. Here we developed
a novel statistical framework to identify statistical covariances from the
infection time-series of multiple pathogens simultaneously. Our framework
extends Bayesian multivariate disease mapping models to analyse multivariate
time series data by accounting for within- and between-year dependencies in
infection risk and incorporating a between-pathogen covariance matrix which we
estimate. Importantly, our approach accounts for possible confounding drivers
of temporal patterns in pathogen infection frequencies, enabling robust
inference of pathogen-pathogen interactions. We illustrate the validity of our
statistical framework using simulated data and applied it to diagnostic data
available for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban
population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human
metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found
positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions
among specific virus pairs. This statistical framework enables a community
ecology perspective to be applied to infectious disease epidemiology with
important utility for public health planning and preparedness.

    <title>A Simple Prediction Model for the Development Trend of 2019-nCov
  Epidemics Based on Medical Observations</title>
    <summary>  In order to predict the development trend of the 2019 coronavirus
(2019-nCov), we established an prediction model to predict the number of
diagnoses case in China except Hubei Province. From January 25 to January 29,
2020, we optimized 6 prediction models, 5 of them based on the number of
medical observations to predicts the peak time of confirmed diagnosis will
appear on the period of morning of January 29 from 24:00 to February 2 before 5
o'clock 24:00. Then we tracked the data from 24 o'clock on January 29 to 24
o'clock on January 31, and found that the predicted value of the data on the
3rd has a small deviation from the actual value, and the actual value has
always remained within the range predicted by the comprehensive prediction
model 6. Therefore we discloses this finding and will continue to track whether
this pattern can be maintained for longer. We believe that the changes medical
observation case number may help to judge the trend of the epidemic situation
in advance.

    <title>Predictions of 2019-nCoV Transmission Ending via Comprehensive Methods</title>
    <summary>  Since the SARS outbreak in 2003, a lot of predictive epidemiological models
have been proposed. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed as
2019-nCoV, has broken out and is propagating in China and the world. Here we
propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network
(MMODEs-NN) and model-free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions
in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the
previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate
the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free
methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson
distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According
to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for
controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission
of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring
Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to
end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence
methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019-nCoV ending.
We anticipate our work to be a starting point for comprehensive prediction
researches of the 2019-nCoV.

    <title>Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic</title>
    <summary>  Containment, the key strategy in quickly halting an epidemic, requires rapid
identification and quarantine of the infected individuals, determination of
whom they have had close contact with in the previous days and weeks, and
decontamination of locations the infected individual has visited. Achieving
containment demands accurate and timely collection of the infected individual's
location and contact history. Traditionally, this process is labor intensive,
susceptible to memory errors, and fraught with privacy concerns. With the
recent almost ubiquitous availability of smart phones, many people carry a tool
which can be utilized to quickly identify an infected individual's contacts
during an epidemic, such as the current 2019 novel Coronavirus crisis.
Unfortunately, the very same first-generation contact tracing tools have been
used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most
private details about individuals. We seek to outline the different
technological approaches to mobile-phone based contact-tracing to date and
elaborate on the opportunities and the risks that these technologies pose to
individuals and societies. We describe advanced security enhancing approaches
that can mitigate these risks and describe trade-offs one must make when
developing and deploying any mass contact-tracing technology. With this paper,
our aim is to continue to grow the conversation regarding contact-tracing for
epidemic and pandemic containment and discuss opportunities to advance this
space. We invite feedback and discussion.

    <title>Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and prediction of the human
  interactome</title>
    <summary>  Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells.
Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of &gt;2500 coronaviruses and
computed &gt;100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that the 3 and 5 prime ends are
the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5 prime end has the
strongest propensity to associate with human proteins. The domain encompassing
nucleotides 23000-24000 is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural
level, while the region upstream varies significantly. These two sequences code
for a domain of the viral protein Spike S that interacts with the human
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and has the potential to bind
sialic acids. Our predictions indicate that the first 1000 nucleotides in the 5
prime end can interact with proteins involved in viral RNA processing such as
double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases, in
addition to other high-confidence candidate partners. These interactions,
previously reported to be also implicated in HIV, reveal important information
on host-virus interactions. The list of transcriptional and
post-transcriptional elements recruited by SARS-CoV-2 genome provides clues on
the biological pathways associated with gene expression changes in human cells.

    <title>Identifying highly influential travellers for spreading disease on a
  public transport system</title>
    <summary>  The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus and its rapid spread underlines
the importance of understanding human mobility. Enclosed spaces, such as public
transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for
infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns
and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus
critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For
instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent
in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions
such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider
multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for
the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide
smart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus
passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the
distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate
disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We
investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while
varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our
results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions
simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different
groups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single
dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given
specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination
efforts.

    <title>State Space Advanced Fuzzy Cognitive Map approach for automatic and non
  Invasive diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease</title>
    <summary>  Purpose: In this study, the recently emerged advances in Fuzzy Cognitive Maps
(FCM) are investigated and employed, for achieving the automatic and
non-invasive diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Methods: A
Computer-Aided Diagnostic model for the acceptable and non-invasive prediction
of CAD using the State Space Advanced FCM (AFCM) approach is proposed. Also, a
rule-based mechanism is incorporated, to further increase the knowledge of the
system and the interpretability of the decision mechanism. The proposed method
is tested utilizing a CAD dataset from the Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine of
the University of Patras. More specifically, two architectures of AFCMs are
designed, and different parameter testing is performed. Furthermore, the
proposed AFCMs, which are based on the new equations proposed recently, are
compared with the traditional FCM approach. Results: The experiments highlight
the effectiveness of the AFCM approach and the new equations over the
traditional approach, which obtained an accuracy of 78.21%, achieving an
increase of seven percent (+7%) on the classification task, and obtaining
85.47% accuracy. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that the AFCM approach in
developing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps outperforms the conventional approach, while it
constitutes a reliable method for the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease.
Conclusions and future research related to recent pandemic of coronavirus are
provided.

    <title>A time-dependent SEIR model to analyse the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2
  epidemic outbreak in Portugal</title>
    <summary>  Background: The analysis of the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic is of paramount
importance to understand the dynamics of the coronavirus spread. This can help
health and government authorities take the appropriate measures and implement
suitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it. Methods: A
time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during
the MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of
active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the
virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable
parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of
about 22,000 active cases is estimated, although the official value for
recovered cases is out of date. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about
1,250 cases, of which 200/300 in ICU units. Conclusion: With appropriate
measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled at about
22,000 people, of which about 1,250 hospitalized and 200/300 in ICU units. This
seems manageable by the country national health service with an estimated 1,140
ventilators.

    <title>PANDA: Policy-aware Location Privacy for Epidemic Surveillance</title>
    <summary>  In this demonstration, we present a privacy-preserving epidemic surveillance
system. Recently, many countries that suffer from coronavirus crises attempt to
access citizen's location data to eliminate the outbreak. However, it raises
privacy concerns and may open the doors to more invasive forms of surveillance
in the name of public health. It also brings a challenge for privacy protection
techniques: how can we leverage people's mobile data to help combat the
pandemic without scarifying our location privacy. We demonstrate that we can
have the best of the two worlds by implementing policy-based location privacy
for epidemic surveillance. Specifically, we formalize the privacy policy using
graphs in light of differential privacy, called policy graph. Our system has
three primary functions for epidemic surveillance: location monitoring,
epidemic analysis, and contact tracing. We provide an interactive tool allowing
the attendees to explore and examine the usability of our system: (1) the
utility of location monitor and disease transmission model estimation, (2) the
procedure of contact tracing in our systems, and (3) the privacy-utility
trade-offs w.r.t. different policy graphs. The attendees can find that it is
possible to have the full functionality of epidemic surveillance while
preserving location privacy.

    <title>Modelling the downhill of the Sars-Cov-2 in Italy and a universal
  forecast of the epidemic in the world</title>
    <summary>  In a previous article [1] we have described the temporal evolution of the
Sars- Cov-2 in Italy in the time window February 24-April 1. As we can see in
[1] a generalized logistic equation captures both the peaks of the total
infected and the deaths. In this article our goal is to study the missing peak,
i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April
7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior
of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model,
introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1]
(for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this
way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4
populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths.
Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the
evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus
applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio
infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this
parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three
countries. We think that this trend could be useful for a future epidemic of
this coronavirus.

    <title>RetinaMask: A Face Mask detector</title>
    <summary>  Coronavirus disease 2019 has affected the world seriously. One major
protection method for people is to wear masks in public areas. Furthermore,
many public service providers require customers to use the service only if they
wear masks correctly. However, there are only a few research studies about face
mask detection based on image analysis. In this paper, we propose
RetinaFaceMask, which is a high-accuracy and efficient face mask detector. The
proposed RetinaFaceMask is a one-stage detector, which consists of a feature
pyramid network to fuse high-level semantic information with multiple feature
maps, and a novel context attention module to focus on detecting face masks. In
addition, we also propose a novel cross-class object removal algorithm to
reject predictions with low confidences and the high intersection of union.
Experiment results show that RetinaFaceMask achieves state-of-the-art results
on a public face mask dataset with $2.3\%$ and $1.5\%$ higher than the baseline
result in the face and mask detection precision, respectively, and $11.0\%$ and
$5.9\%$ higher than baseline for recall. Besides, we also explore the
possibility of implementing RetinaFaceMask with a light-weighted neural network
MobileNet for embedded or mobile devices.

    <title>Immunological determinants of clinical outcomes in COVID-19: A
  quantitative perspective</title>
    <summary>  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a variable
clinical presentation that ranges from asymptomatic, to severe disease with
cytokine storm. The mortality rates also differ across the globe, ranging from
0.5-13%. This variation is likely due to both pathogen and host factors. Host
factors may include genetic differences in the immune response genes as well as
variation in HLA and KIR allotypes. To better understand what impact these
genetic variants in immune response genes may have in the differences observed
in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, a quantitative analysis of a dynamical
systems model that considers both, the magnitude of viral growth, and the
subsequent innate and adaptive response required to achieve control of
infection is considered. Based on this broad quantitative framework it may be
posited that the spectrum of symptomatic to severely symptomatic presentations
of COVID19 represents the balance between innate and adaptive immune responses.
In asymptomatic patients, prompt and adequate adaptive immune response quells
infection, whereas in those with severe symptoms a slower inadequate adaptive
response leads to a runaway cytokine cascade fueled by ongoing viral
replication. Polymorphisms in the various components of the innate and adaptive
immune response may cause altered immune response kinetics that would result in
variable severity of illness. Understanding how this genetic variation may
alter the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to develop successful
treatment strategies.

    <title>Mathematical Modeling of Business Reopening when Facing SARS-CoV-2
  Pandemic: Protection, Cost and Risk</title>
    <summary>  The sudden onset of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in
tremendous loss of human life and economy in more than 210 countries and
territories around the world. While self-protections such as wearing mask,
sheltering in place and quarantine polices and strategies are necessary for
containing virus transmission, tens of millions people in the U.S. have lost
their jobs due to the shutdown of businesses. Therefore, how to reopen the
economy safely while the virus is still circulating in population has become a
problem of significant concern and importance to elected leaders and business
executives. In this study, mathematical modeling is employed to quantify the
profit generation and the infection risk simultaneously from the point of view
of a business entity. Specifically, an ordinary differential equation model was
developed to characterize disease transmission and infection risk. An algebraic
equation is proposed to determine the net profit that a business entity can
generate after reopening and take into account the costs associated of several
protection/quarantine guidelines. All model parameters were calibrated based on
various data and information sources. Sensitivity analyses and case studies
were performed to illustrate the use of the model in practice.

    <title>Desperate times call for desperate measures: government spending
  multipliers in hard times</title>
    <summary>  We investigate state-dependent effects of fiscal multipliers and allow for
endogenous sample splitting to determine whether the US economy is in a slack
state. When the endogenized slack state is estimated as the period of the
unemployment rate higher than about 12 percent, the estimated cumulative
multipliers are significantly larger during slack periods than non-slack
periods and are above unity. We also examine the possibility of time-varying
regimes of slackness and find that our empirical results are robust under a
more flexible framework. Our estimation results point out the importance of the
heterogenous effects of fiscal policy and shed light on the prospect of fiscal
policy in response to economic shocks from the current COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Phylogenetic study of 2019-nCoV by using alignment-free method</title>
    <summary>  The origin and early spread of 2019-nCoV is studied by phylogenetic analysis
using IC-PIC alignment-free method based on DNA/RNA sequence information
correlation (IC) and partial information correlation (PIC). The topology of
phylogenetic tree of Betacoronavirus is remarkably consistent with biologist's
systematics, classifies 2019-nCoV as Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus and
supports the assumption that these novel viruses are of bat origin with
pangolin as one of the possible intermediate hosts. The novel virus branch of
phylogenetic tree shows location-virus linkage. The placement of root of the
early 2019-nCoV tree is studied carefully in Neighbor Joining consensus
algorithm by introducing different out-groups (Bat-related coronaviruses,
Pangolin coronaviruses and HIV viruses etc.) and comparing with UPGMA consensus
trees. Several oldest branches (lineages) of the 2019-nCoV tree are deduced
that means the COVID-19 may begin to spread in several regions in the world
before its outbreak in Wuhan.

    <title>Pathogen Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) Versus Proinflammatory
  Anti-Pathogen Species (PIAPS) Levels: Modelling and Therapeutic Strategies</title>
    <summary>  Current CoVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide, and it may become
one of the largest pandemic events in modern history if out of control. It
appears most of the SARS-CoV2 virus infection resulted deaths are mainly due to
dysfunctions or failures of the lung or multiple organs that could be
attributed to hosts immunodysfunctions particularly hyperinflammatory type
disorders. In this brief review and study, a math model is proposed to
correlate the Pathogen Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) versus
Proinflammatory Anti-Pathogen Species (PIAPS) levels within a host unit, where
a maximum PIRP is exhibited when the PIAPS levels are equal to or around PIAPS
equilibrium levels at the pathogen elimination or clearance onset. Based on
this model, rational or effective therapeutic strategies at right stages or
timing, with right type of agents (immuno-stimulators or immuno-suppressors),
and right dosages, may be designed and implemented that are expected to
effectively achieve maximum PIRP or reduce the mortality.

    <title>Proximity: a recipe to break the outbreak</title>
    <summary>  We present a mobile app solution to help the containment of an epidemic
outbreak by keeping track of possible infections in the incubation period. We
consider the particular case of an infection which primarily spreads among
people through proximal contact, via respiratory droplets. This smartphone
application will work offline and will be able to detect other devices in close
proximity and list all the interactions in an anonymous and encrypted way. If
an app user is tested positive and so is certified as infected, the application
notifies immediately the potential contagion to the devices in the list and
suggests to start a voluntary quarantine and undergo a medical test. We believe
this solution may be useful in particular in the current COVID-19 pandemic and
moreover could be used to prevent similar events in the future.

    <title>Attention U-Net Based Adversarial Architectures for Chest X-ray Lung
  Segmentation</title>
    <summary>  Chest X-ray is the most common test among medical imaging modalities. It is
applied for detection and differentiation of, among others, lung cancer,
tuberculosis, and pneumonia, the last with importance due to the COVID-19
disease. Integrating computer-aided detection methods into the radiologist
diagnostic pipeline, greatly reduces the doctors' workload, increasing
reliability and quantitative analysis. Here we present a novel deep learning
approach for lung segmentation, a basic, but arduous task in the diagnostic
pipeline. Our method uses state-of-the-art fully convolutional neural networks
in conjunction with an adversarial critic model. It generalized well to CXR
images of unseen datasets with different patient profiles, achieving a final
DSC of 97.5% on the JSRT dataset.

    <title>Why case fatality ratios can be misleading: individual- and
  population-based mortality estimates and factors influencing them</title>
    <summary>  Different ways of calculating mortality ratios during epidemics have yielded
very different results, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We
formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection
duration-dependent SIR model to define individual- and population-based
estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the
dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the
time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that
none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted
case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total
number of confirmed infected cases to date. Using data on the recent SARS-CoV-2
outbreaks, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and
highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose more
systematic methods to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and
discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and uncertainties in the data.

    <title>Planning as Inference in Epidemiological Models</title>
    <summary>  In this work we demonstrate how existing software tools can be used to
automate parts of infectious disease-control policy-making via performing
inference in existing epidemiological dynamics models. The kind of inference
tasks undertaken include computing, for planning purposes, the posterior
distribution over putatively controllable, via direct policy-making choices,
simulation model parameters that give rise to acceptable disease progression
outcomes. Neither the full capabilities of such inference automation software
tools nor their utility for planning is widely disseminated at the current
time. Timely gains in understanding about these tools and how they can be used
may lead to more fine-grained and less economically damaging policy
prescriptions, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Optimising Lockdown Policies for Epidemic Control using Reinforcement
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  In the context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, several reports and studies
have attempted to model and predict the spread of the disease. There is also
intense debate about policies for limiting the damage, both to health and to
the economy. On the one hand, the health and safety of the population is the
principal consideration for most countries. On the other hand, we cannot ignore
the potential for long-term economic damage caused by strict nation-wide
lockdowns. In this working paper, we present a quantitative way to compute
lockdown decisions for individual cities or regions, while balancing health and
economic considerations. Furthermore, these policies are learnt automatically
by the proposed algorithm, as a function of disease parameters (infectiousness,
gestation period, duration of symptoms, probability of death) and population
characteristics (density, movement propensity). We account for realistic
considerations such as imperfect lockdowns, and show that the policy obtained
using reinforcement learning is a viable quantitative approach towards
lockdowns.

    <title>Propagation and mitigation of epidemics in a scale-free network</title>
    <summary>  The epidemic curve and the final extent of the COVID-19 pandemic are usually
predicted from the rate of early exponential raising using the SIR model. These
predictions implicitly assume a full social mixing, which is not plausible
generally. Here I am showing a counterexample to the these predictions, based
on random propagation of an epidemic in Barab\'asi--Albert scale-free network
models. The start of the epidemic suggests $R_0=2.6$, but unlike $\Omega\approx
70\%{}$ predicted by the SIR model, they reach a final extent of only
$\Omega\approx 4\%{}$ without external mitigation and $\Omega\approx
0.5$--$1.5\%{}$ with mitigation. Daily infection rate at the top is also 1--1.5
orders of magnitude less than in SIR models. Quarantining only the 1.5\%{} most
active superspreaders has similar effect on extent and top infection rate as
blind quarantining a random 50\%{} of the full community.

    <title>Optimal, near-optimal, and robust epidemic control</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for control measures that
reduce the epidemic peak ("flattening the curve"). Here we derive the optimal
time-limited intervention for reducing peak epidemic prevalence in the standard
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. We show that alternative, more
practical interventions can perform nearly as well as the provably optimal
strategy. However, none of these strategies are robust to implementation
errors: mistiming the start of the intervention by even a single week can be
enormously costly, for realistic epidemic parameters. Sustained control
measures, though less efficient than optimal and near-optimal time-limited
interventions, can be used in combination with time-limited strategies to
mitigate the catastrophic risks of mistiming.

    <title>Variable pool testing for infection spread estimation</title>
    <summary>  We present a method for efficient estimation of the prevalence of infection
in a population with high accuracy using only a small number of tests. The
presented approach uses pool testing with a mix of pool sizes of various sizes.
The test results are then combined to generate an accurate estimation over a
wide range of infection probabilities. This method does not require an initial
guess on the infection probability. We show that, using the suggested method,
even a set of only $50$ tests with a total of only $1000$ samples can produce
reasonable estimation over a wide range of probabilities. A measurement set
with only $100$ tests is shown to achieve $25\%$ accuracy over infection
probabilities from $0.001$ to $0.5$. The presented method is applicable to
COVID-19 testing.

    <title>Improving Baseline Subtraction for Increased Sensitivity of Quantitative
  PCR Measurements</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the current COVID-19 health-crisis, we examine the task of
baseline subtraction for quantitative polymerase chain-reaction (qPCR)
measurements. In particular, we present an algorithm that leverages information
obtained from non-template and/or DNA extraction-control experiments to remove
systematic bias from amplification curves. We recast this problem in terms of
mathematical optimization, i.e. by finding the amount of control signal that,
when subtracted from an amplification curve, minimizes background noise. We
demonstrate that this approach can yield a decade improvement in sensitivity
relative to standard approaches, especially for data exhibiting late-cycle
amplification. Critically, this increased sensitivity and accuracy promises
more effective screening of viral DNA and a reduction in the rate of
false-negatives in diagnostic settings.

    <title>A sample approach to the estimation of the critical parameters of the
  SARS-CoV-2 epidemics: an operational design with a focus on the Italian
  health system</title>
    <summary>  Given the urgent informational needs connected with the pandemic diffusion of
the Covid-19 infection, in this paper we propose a sample design to build up a
continuous-time surveillance system. With respect to other observational
strategies, our proposal has three important elements of strength and
originality: (i) it not only aims at providing a snapshot of the phenomenon in
a single moment of time, but it is designed to be a continuous survey, repeated
in several waves through time, (ii) the statistical optimality properties of
the estimators are formally derived in this paper and (iii) it is rapidly
operational as it is required by the emergency connected with diffusion of the
virus. The sample design is thought having in mind, in particular, the
SAR-CoV-2 diffusion in Italy during the Spring of 2020. However, the proposed
sampling design is very general, and we are confident that it could be easily
extended to other geographical areas and to possible future epidemic outbreaks.

    <title>Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing: current solutions and open questions</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a unique challenge for the world to find
solutions, ranging from vaccines to ICT solutions to slow down the virus
spreading. Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, social distancing
is one fundamental measure which has already adopted by many countries. At the
technical level, this prioritises contact tracing solutions, which can alert
the users who have been in close contact with the infected persons and
meanwhile allow heath authorities to take proper actions. In this paper, we
examine several existing privacy-aware contact tracing solutions and analyse
their (dis)advantages. At the end, we describe several major observations and
outline an interdisciplinary research agenda towards more comprehensive and
effective privacy-aware contact tracing solutions.

    <title>Infection arbitrage</title>
    <summary>  Increasing the infection risk early in an epidemic is individually and
socially optimal under some parameter values. The reason is that the early
patients recover or die before the peak of the epidemic, which flattens the
peak. This improves welfare if the peak exceeds the capacity of the healthcare
system and the social loss rises rapidly enough in the number infected. The
individual incentive to get infected early comes from the greater likelihood of
receiving treatment than at the peak when the disease has overwhelmed
healthcare capacity. Calibration to the Covid-19 pandemic data suggests that
catching the infection at the start was individually optimal and for some loss
functions would have reduced the aggregate loss.

    <title>Predictability: Can the turning point and end of an expanding epidemic
  be precisely forecast?</title>
    <summary>  No, they can't. Exponentially growing dynamics are intrinsically
unpredictable. The time at which the number of infected individuals starts
decreasing cannot be reliably calculated before it is actually attained. A
standard SIR model with confinement shows that infection spread is inhibited
only above a threshold. Confinement induces a slow-down in the expansion phase
that does not guarantee an eventual control of the epidemic. A Bayesian fit to
the on-going COVID-19 pandemic in Spain shows that we can infer neither its
peaking time nor whether there is a peak at all. The dispersion of possible
trajectories grows extremely fast, yielding a short horizon for reliable
prediction. As unpredictability is intrinsic, not due to incomplete or wrong
data, our study advocates for a scenario of probabilistic forecasting.

    <title>Digital tools against COVID-19: Framing the ethical challenges and how
  to address them</title>
    <summary>  Data collection and processing via digital public health technologies are
being promoted worldwide by governments and private companies as strategic
remedies for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic and loosening lockdown measures.
However, the ethical and legal boundaries of deploying digital tools for
disease surveillance and control purposes are unclear, and a rapidly evolving
debate has emerged globally around the promises and risks of mobilizing digital
tools for public health. To help scientists and policymakers navigate
technological and ethical uncertainty, we present a typology of the primary
digital public health applications currently in use. Namely: proximity and
contact tracing, symptom monitoring, quarantine control, and flow modeling. For
each, we discuss context-specific risks, cross-sectional issues, and ethical
concerns. Finally, in recognition of the need for practical guidance, we
propose a navigation aid for policymakers made up of ten steps for the ethical
use of digital public health tools.

    <title>Novel Corona virus Disease infection in Tunisia: Mathematical model and
  the impact of the quarantine strategy</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a new model for the dynamics of COVID-19
infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans,
exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine
population, the recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved first
through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a
solution to considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free
equilibrium and corresp onding stability. Hence, the actual reproduction number
was calculated . We analyzed the dependence of basic reproductions R_0 on the
confidence of our model. Our work shows, in particular, that the disease will
decrease out if the number of reproduction was less than one. Moreover, the
impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is
discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations
of the system of the epidemic's differential equations.

    <title>OUTBREAK: A user-friendly georeferencing online tool for disease
  surveillance</title>
    <summary>  The current COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed more than 100,000 victims
and it will cause more deaths in the coming months. Tools that can track the
number and locations of cases are critical for surveillance and can help in
making policy decisions for controlling the outbreak. The current surveillance
web-based dashboards run on proprietary platforms, which are often expensive
and require specific computational knowledge. We present a new tool (OUTBREAK)
for studying and visualizing epidemiological data. It permits even
non-specialist users to input data most conveniently and track outbreaks in
real-time. This tool has the potential to guide and help health authorities to
intervene and minimize the effects of the outbreaks. It is freely available at
http://outbreak.sysbio.tools/.

    <title>How long does a lockdown need to be?</title>
    <summary>  Social distancing, often in the form of lockdown, has been adopted by many
countries as a way to contrast the spreading of COVID-19. We discuss the
temporal aspects of social distancing in contrasting an epidemic diffusion. We
argue that a strategy based uniquely on social distancing requires to maintain
the relative measures for a very long time, while a more articulate strategy,
which also uses early detection and prompt isolation, can be both more
efficient on reducing the epidemic peak and allow to relax the social
distancing measures after a much shorter time. We consider in more detail the
situation in Italy, simulating the effect of different strategies through a
recently introduced SIR-type epidemiological model. The short answer to the
question in the title is: "it depends on what else you do".

    <title>Predictive data assimilation through Reduced Order Modeling for
  epidemics with data uncertainty</title>
    <summary>  In this article, we develop a data assimilation procedure to predict the
evolution of epidemics with data uncertainty, with application to the Covid-19
pandemic. We construct a vademecum of solutions by solving the SIR epidemic
model for a set of data neighboring the estimated real (or official) ones. A
reduced basis is constructed from this vademecum through Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD). The reduced POD base is then applied to assimilate the
pandemic data (infected, recovered, deceased) during the period in which data
are known, by a least squares procedure. The fitted curves are then used to
predict the evolution of the pandemic in the next days. Validation tests for
Andalusia region (Spain), Italy and Spain show accurate predictions for 7 days
that improve as the number of assimilated data increases.

    <title>Dynamics of Interacting Hotspots - II</title>
    <summary>  In the absence of any proper clinical solution, human civilization is only
left with sophisticated intervention measures to contain the spread of
COVID-19. However, the existing models to estimate the intervention does not
take into account the realistic connectivity of the epicentres of the pandemic.
We generalise our earlier model of interacting hotspots to test various
possibilities of intervention in a model state consisting of multiple
epicentres. We also analyse situations when the hotspots are spatially
correlated and the interaction is limited to population exchanges with the
nearest neighbours. We show that the heterogeneity in the infection propagation
is solely dependent on the protocol of the containment and its strength. We
explore many such situations and discuss possibilities.

    <title>Dynamics of Interacting Hotspots -- I</title>
    <summary>  The worldwide spread of COVID-19 has called for fast advancement of new
modelling strategies to estimate its unprecedented spread. Here, we introduce a
model based on the fundamental SIR equations with a stochastic disorder by a
random exchange of infected populations between cities to study dynamics in an
interacting network of epicentres in a model state. Although each stochastic
exchange conserves populations pair-wise, the disorder drives the global system
towards newer routes to dynamic equilibrium. Upon controlling the range of the
exchange fraction, we show that it is possible to control the heterogeneity in
the spread and the co-operativity among the interacting hotspots. Data of
collective temporal evolution of the infected populations in federal states of
Germany validate the qualitative features of the model.

    <title>Analysing the combined health, social and economic impacts of the
  corovanvirus pandemic using agent-based social simulation</title>
    <summary>  During the COVID-19 crisis there have been many difficult decisions
governments and other decision makers had to make. E.g. do we go for a total
lock down or keep schools open? How many people and which people should be
tested? Although there are many good models from e.g. epidemiologists on the
spread of the virus under certain conditions, these models do not directly
translate into the interventions that can be taken by government. Neither can
these models contribute to understand the economic and/or social consequences
of the interventions. However, effective and sustainable solutions need to take
into account this combination of factors. In this paper, we propose an
agent-based social simulation tool, ASSOCC, that supports decision makers
understand possible consequences of policy interventions, bu exploring the
combined social, health and economic consequences of these interventions.

    <title>Proceedings Eighth Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional
  Programming</title>
    <summary>  This volume contains the proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Mathematically
Structured Functional Programming (MSFP 2020). The meeting was originally
scheduled to take place in Dublin, Ireland on the 25th of April as a satellite
event of the European Joint Conferences on Theory &amp; Practice of Software (ETAPS
2020).
  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ETAPS 2020, and consequently MSFP 2020, has
been postponed to a date yet to be determined.
  The MSFP workshop highlights applications of mathematical structures to
programming applications. We promote the use of category theory, type theory,
and formal language semantics to the development of simple and reasonable
programs. This year's papers cover a variety of topics ranging from array
programming to dependent types to effects.

    <title>Privacy Preservation in Epidemic Data Collection</title>
    <summary>  This work is inspired by the outbreak of COVID-19, and some of the challenges
we have observed with gathering data about the disease. To this end, we aim to
help collect data about citizens and the disease without risking the privacy of
individuals. Specifically, we focus on how to determine the density of the
population across the country, how to trace contact between citizens, how to
determine the location of infections, and how to determine the timeline of the
spread of the disease. Our proposed methods are privacy-preserving and rely on
an app to be voluntarily installed on citizens' smartphones. Thus, any
individual can choose not to participate. However, the accurateness of the
methods relies on the participation of a large percentage of the population.

    <title>Fact or Fiction: Verifying Scientific Claims</title>
    <summary>  We introduce scientific claim verification, a new task to select abstracts
from the research literature containing evidence that supports or refutes a
given scientific claim, and to identify rationales justifying each decision. To
study this task, we construct SciFact, a dataset of 1.4K expert-written
scientific claims paired with evidence-containing abstracts annotated with
labels and rationales. We develop baseline models for SciFact, and demonstrate
that these models benefit from combined training on a large dataset of claims
about Wikipedia articles, together with the new SciFact data. We show that our
claim verification system is able to identify plausible evidence for 23 / 36
claims relevant to COVID-19 on the CORD-19 corpus. Our results and experiments
strongly suggest that our new task and data will support significant future
research efforts.

    <title>Gene-Environment Interaction in the Era of Precision Medicine -- Fix the
  Potholes or Start Building a New Road?</title>
    <summary>  Genetic mapping sprung in the last decade of the 20th century with the
development of statistical procedures putting classical models of genetic
effects together with molecular biology techniques. It eventually became clear
that those models, originally developed to serve other purposes, implied
limitations at different stages of the analyses-disclosing loci, measuring
their effects and providing additional parameters for adequate
biological/medical interpretations. The present paper is aimed to ponder
whether it is realistic and worth to try and further amend classical models of
genetic effects or it proves more sensible to undertake alternative theoretical
strategies instead. In order to further feed into that debate, mathematical
developments for gene-environment interaction stemming from the classical
models of genetic effects are here revised and brought up-to-date with the
prospects present-day available data bestow, particularly in the context of
precision medicine. Those developments strengthen the methodology required to
overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <title>Converting Hemodialysis (HD) membranes to Extracorporeal Membrane
  Oxygenation (ECMO) machines</title>
    <summary>  Crises like COVID-19 can create a massive unmet demand for rare blood
oxygenation membrane machines for impaired lungs: Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation (ECMO) machines. Meanwhile, Hemodialysis (HD) machines, which use
membranes to supplement failing kidneys, are extremely common and widespread,
with orders of magnitude more available than for ECMO machines. This short
study examines whether the membranes for HD can be modified for use in blood
oxygenation (ECMO). To do so, it considers mass transfer at the micro-scale
level, and calculations for the macro-scale level such as blood pumping rates
and O2 supply pressure. Overall, while this conversion may technically be
possible, poor gas transport likely requires multiple HD membranes for one
patient.

    <title>Domain Adaptation in Highly Imbalanced and Overlapping Datasets</title>
    <summary>  In many machine learning domains, datasets are characterized by highly
imbalanced and overlapping classes. Particularly in the medical domain, a
specific list of symptoms can be labeled as one of various different
conditions. Some of these conditions may be more prevalent than others by
several orders of magnitude. Here we present a novel unsupervised domain
adaptation scheme for such datasets. The scheme, based on a specific type of
Quantification, is designed to work under both label and conditional shifts. It
is demonstrated on datasets generated from electronic health records and
provides high quality results for both Quantification and Domain Adaptation in
very challenging scenarios. Potential benefits of using this scheme in the
current COVID-19 outbreak, for estimation of prevalence and probability of
infection are discussed.

    <title>How good is good enough for COVID19 apps? The influence of benefits,
  accuracy, and privacy on willingness to adopt</title>
    <summary>  A growing number of contact tracing apps are being developed to complement
manual contact tracing. A key question is whether users will be willing to
adopt these contact tracing apps. In this work, we survey over 4,500 Americans
to evaluate (1) the effect of both accuracy and privacy concerns on reported
willingness to install COVID19 contact tracing apps and (2) how different
groups of users weight accuracy vs. privacy. Drawing on our findings from these
first two research questions, we (3) quantitatively model how the amount of
public health benefit (reduction in infection rate), amount of individual
benefit (true-positive detection of exposures to COVID), and degree of privacy
risk in a hypothetical contact tracing app may influence American's willingness
to install. Our work takes a descriptive ethics approach toward offering
implications for the development of policy and app designs related to COVID19.

    <title>Causal Estimation of Stay-at-Home Orders on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission</title>
    <summary>  Accurately estimating the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders (SHOs) on
reducing social contact and disease spread is crucial for mitigating pandemics.
Leveraging individual-level location data for 10 million smartphones, we
observe that by April 30th---when nine in ten Americans were under a
SHO---daily movement had fallen 70% from pre-COVID levels. One-quarter of this
decline is causally attributable to SHOs, with wide demographic differences in
compliance, most notably by political affiliation. Likely Trump voters reduce
movement by 9% following a local SHO, compared to a 21% reduction among their
Clinton-voting neighbors, who face similar exposure risks and identical
government orders. Linking social distancing behavior with an epidemic model,
we estimate that reductions in movement have causally reduced SARS-CoV-2
transmission rates by 49%.

    <title>Kaplan-Meier type survival curves for COVID-19: a health data based
  decision-making tool</title>
    <summary>  Countries are recording health information on the global spread of COVID-19
using different methods, sometimes changing the rules after a few days. They
are all publishing the number of new individuals infected, cured and dead,
along with some supplementary data. These figures are often recorded in a
non-uniform manner and do not match the standard definitions of these
variables. However, in this paper we show that the Kaplan-Meier curves
calculated with them could provide useful information about the dynamics of the
disease in different countries. Our aim is to present a robust and simple model
to show certain characteristics of the evolution of the dynamic process,
showing that the differences of evolution among the countries is reflected in
the corresponding Kaplan-Meier-type curves. We compare the curves obtained for
the most affected countries so far, proposing possible interpretations of the
properties that distinguish them.

    <title>India Growth Forecast for 2020-21</title>
    <summary>  COVID-19 has put a severe dent on the global economy and Indian Economy.
International Monetary Fund has projected 1.9 percent for India. However, we
believe that due to extended lockdown, the output in the first quarter is
almost wiped out. The situation may improve in the second quarter onwards.
Nevertheless, due to demand and supply constraints, input constraints and
disruption in the supply chain, except agriculture, no other sector would be
able to achieve full capacity of production in 2020-21. The signals from power
consumption, GST collection, contraction in the core sectors hint towards a
slump in the total output production in 2020-21. We derive the quarterly GVA
for 2020-21 by using certain assumptions on the capacity utilisation in
different sectors and using the quarterly data of 2019-20. We provide quarterly
estimates of Gross Value Addition for 2020-21 under two scenarios. We have also
estimated the fourth quarter output for 2019-20 under certain assumptions. We

    <title>Conservative two-stage group testing</title>
    <summary>  Inspired by applications in testing for COVID-19, we consider a variant of
two-stage group testing we call "conservative" two-stage testing, where every
item declared to be defective must be definitively confirmed by being tested by
itself in the second stage. We study this in the linear regime where the
prevalence is fixed while the number of items is large. We study various
nonadaptive test designs for the first stage, and derive a new lower bound for
the total number of tests required. We find that a first-stage design with
constant tests per item and constant items per test due to Broder and Kumar
(arXiv:2004.01684) is extremely close to optimal. Simulations back up the
theoretical results.

    <title>Inference for a test-negative case-control study with added controls</title>
    <summary>  Test-negative designs with added controls have recently been proposed to
study COVID-19. An individual is test-positive or test-negative accordingly if
they took a test for a disease but tested positive or tested negative. Adding a
control group to a comparison of test-positives vs test-negatives is useful
since additional comparison of test-positives vs controls can have potential
biases different from the first comparison. Bonferroni correction ensures
necessary type-I error control for these two comparisons done simultaneously.
We propose two new methods for inference which have better interpretability and
higher statistical power for these designs. These methods add a third
comparison that is essentially independent of the first comparison, but our
proposed second method often pays much less for these three comparisons than
what a Bonferroni correction would pay for the two comparisons.

    <title>Modelling the spread of Covid19 in Italy using a revised version of the
  SIR model</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present a model to predict the spread of the Covid-19
epidemic and apply it to the specific case of Italy. We started from a simple
Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model and we added the condition that,
after a certain time, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ exponentially decays
in time, as empirically suggested by world data. Using this model, we were able
to reproduce the real behavior of the epidemic with an average error of 5\%.
Moreover, we illustrate possible future scenarios, associated to different
intervals of $R_0$. This model has been used since the beginning of March 2020,
predicting the Italian peak of the epidemic in April 2020 with about 100.000
detected active cases. The real peak of the epidemic happened on the 20th of
April 2020, with 108.000 active cases. This result shows that the model had
predictive power for the italian case.

    <title>Reproduction matrix for an epidemic and lockdowns in a city</title>
    <summary>  We consider an epidemic spreading in a city which is divided geographically
into different districts. We introduce the reproduction matrix
$\R=\bigl(R(i,j)\bigr)$ between districts, where $R(i,j)$ is the mean number of
individuals in district $j$ infected by an individual from district $i$. We
analyse policies of partial lockdowns of the city, that is of a set of
districts, based on the study of matrix $\R$, where rows and columns
corresponding to districts in lockdown are set to zero. This schema can also be
applied to a country divided into regions or other appropriate units, provided
the relevant information is available. We conclude by analyzing a matrix~$\R$
which was constructed for the spread of COVID-19 in Santiago, Chile, with the
aid of an agent-based simulator for generating surrogate district data.

    <title>Fomite transmission and disinfection strategies for SARS-CoV-2 and
  related viruses</title>
    <summary>  Contaminated objects or surfaces, referred to as fomites, play a critical
role in the spread of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for
the COVID-19 pandemic. The long persistence of viruses (hours to days) on
surfaces calls for an urgent need for surface disinfection strategies to
intercept virus transmission and the spread of the disease. Elucidating the
physicochemical processes and surface science underlying the adsorption and
transfer of virus between surfaces, as well as their inactivation, are
important in understanding how the disease is transmitted, and in developing
effective interception strategies. This review aims to summarize the current
knowledge and underlying physicochemical processes of virus transmission, in
particular via fomites, and common disinfection approaches. Gaps in knowledge
and needs for further research are also identified. The review focuses on
SARS-CoV-2, but will supplement the discussions with related viruses.

    <title>Protein-ligand interaction study to identify potential dietary compounds
  binding at the active site of therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2</title>
    <summary>  Objective: Total 186 biologically important phenylpropanoids and polyketides
compounds from different Indian medicinal plants and dietary sources were
screened to filter potential compounds that bind at the active site of the
therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Method: The molecular docking
studies were carried out by using the Autodock Vina. The in silico ADMET and
drug-likeness properties of the compounds were predicted from SwissADME server.
Result: The molecular docking study of the 186 compounds with the therapeutic
target proteins (Mpro, PLpro, RdRp, SGp and ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2 resulted 40
compounds that bind at the active site with dock score above -8.0 kcal/mol.
Conclusion: Based on the in silico ADMET study and drug-likeness prediction of
40 compounds, we proposed petunidin, baicalein, cyanidin,
7-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan, quercetin and ellagic acid among the 186
biologically important phenylpropanoids and polyketides as potential lead
compounds, which can further be investigated pharmacologically and clinically
to formulate therapeutic approaches for the COVID-19.

    <title>COVID-19: Nowcasting Reproduction Factors Using Biased Case Testing Data</title>
    <summary>  Timely estimation of the current value for COVID-19 reproduction factor $R$
has become a key aim of efforts to inform management strategies. $R$ is an
important metric used by policy-makers in setting mitigation levels and is also
important for accurate modelling of epidemic progression. This brief paper
introduces a method for estimating $R$ from biased case testing data. Using
testing data, rather than hospitalisation or death data, provides a much
earlier metric along the symptomatic progression scale. This can be hugely
important when fighting the exponential nature of an epidemic. We develop a
practical estimator and apply it to Scottish case testing data to infer a
current (20 May 2020) $R$ value of $0.74$ with $95\%$ confidence interval
$[0.48 - 0.86]$.

    <title>zkSNARKs to the rescue: proof-of-contact in zero knowledge</title>
    <summary>  This paper describes techniques to help with COVID-19 automated contact
tracing, and with the restoration efforts. We describe a decentralized protocol
for ``proof-of-contact'' (PoC) in zero knowledge where a person can publish a
short cryptographic proof attesting to the fact that they have been infected
and that they have come in contact with a set of people without revealing any
information about any of the people involved. More importantly, we describe how
to compose these proofs to support broader functionality such as proofs of
$n$th-order (transitive) exposure which can further speed up automated contact
tracing. The cryptographic proofs can be publicly verified, and in both cases,
the burden is on the person proving contact and not on third parties or
healthcare providers rendering the system more decentralized, and accordingly
more scalable.

    <title>Cross Hashing: Anonymizing encounters in Decentralised Contact Tracing
  Protocols</title>
    <summary>  During the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, Contact Tracing emerged as an
essential tool for managing the epidemic. App-based solutions have emerged for
Contact Tracing, including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced
by an open-source protocol known as DP3T). This protocol contains two
well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly that when someone is marked
as having tested positive and their keys are made public, they can be tracked
over a large geographic area for 24 hours at a time. Secondly, whilst the app
requires a minimum exposure duration to register a contact, there is no
cryptographic guarantee for this property. This means an adversary can scan
Bluetooth networks and retrospectively find who is infected. We propose a novel
"cross hashing" approach to cryptographically guarantee minimum exposure
durations. We further mitigate the 24-hour data exposure of infected
individuals and reduce computational time for identifying if a user has been
exposed using k-Anonymity buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection.

    <title>Benchmarking Differentially Private Residual Networks for Medical
  Imagery</title>
    <summary>  Hospitals and other medical institutions often have vast amounts of medical
data which can provide significant value when utilized to advance research.
However, this data is often sensitive in nature, and as such is not readily
available for use in a research setting, often due to privacy concerns. In this
paper, we measure the performance of a deep neural network on differentially
private image datasets pertaining to Pneumonia. We analyze the trade-off
between the model's accuracy and the scale of perturbation among the images.
Knowing how the model's accuracy varies among various perturbation levels in
differentially private medical images is useful in these contexts. This work is
contextually significant given the corona-virus pandemic, as Pneumonia has
become an even greater concern owing to its potentially deadly complication of
infection with COVID-19.

    <title>Summer vacation and COVID-19: effects of metropolitan people going to
  summer provinces</title>
    <summary>  Many countries are now investigating what the effects of summer vacation
might be on the COVID-19 pandemic. Here one particular such question is
addressed: what will happen if large numbers of metropolitan people visit a
less populated province during the summer vacation? By means of a simple
epidemic model, allowing for both short and long-term visitors to the province,
it is studied which features are most influential in determining if such summer
movements will result in large number of infections among the province
population. The method is applied to the island of Gotland off the South East
coast of Sweden. It is shown that the amount of mixing between the metropolitan
and province groups and the fraction of metropolitan people being infectious
upon arrival are most influential. Consequently, minimizing events gathering
both the province and metropolitan groups and/or reducing the number of
short-term visitors could substantially decrease spreading, as could measures
to lower the fraction initially infectious upon arrival.

    <title>An Empirical Methodology for Detecting and Prioritizing Needs during
  Crisis Events</title>
    <summary>  In times of crisis, identifying the essential needs is a crucial step to
providing appropriate resources and services to affected entities. Social media
platforms such as Twitter contain vast amount of information about the general
public's needs. However, the sparsity of the information as well as the amount
of noisy content present a challenge to practitioners to effectively identify
shared information on these platforms. In this study, we propose two novel
methods for two distinct but related needs detection tasks: the identification
of 1) a list of resources needed ranked by priority, and 2) sentences that
specify who-needs-what resources. We evaluated our methods on a set of tweets
about the COVID-19 crisis. For task 1 (detecting top needs), we compared our
results against two given lists of resources and achieved 64% precision. For
task 2 (detecting who-needs-what), we compared our results on a set of 1,000
annotated tweets and achieved a 68% F1-score.

    <title>Low-Complexity System and Algorithm for an Emergency Ventilator Sensor
  and Alarm</title>
    <summary>  In response to the shortage of ventilators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,
many organizations have designed low-cost emergency ventilators. Many of these
devices are pressure-cycled pneumatic ventilators, which are easy to produce
but often do not include the sensing or alarm features found on commercial
ventilators. This work reports a low-cost, easy-to-produce electronic sensor
and alarm system for pressure-cycled ventilators that estimates clinically
useful metrics such as pressure and respiratory rate and sounds an alarm when
the ventilator malfunctions. A low-complexity signal processing algorithm uses
a pair of nonlinear recursive envelope trackers to monitor the signal from an
electronic pressure sensor connected to the patient airway. The algorithm,
inspired by those used in hearing aids, requires little memory and performs
only a few calculations on each sample so that it can run on nearly any
microcontroller.

    <title>Interactive Extractive Search over Biomedical Corpora</title>
    <summary>  We present a system that allows life-science researchers to search a
linguistically annotated corpus of scientific texts using patterns over
dependency graphs, as well as using patterns over token sequences and a
powerful variant of boolean keyword queries. In contrast to previous attempts
to dependency-based search, we introduce a light-weight query language that
does not require the user to know the details of the underlying linguistic
representations, and instead to query the corpus by providing an example
sentence coupled with simple markup. Search is performed at an interactive
speed due to efficient linguistic graph-indexing and retrieval engine. This
allows for rapid exploration, development and refinement of user queries. We
demonstrate the system using example workflows over two corpora: the PubMed
corpus including 14,446,243 PubMed abstracts and the CORD-19 dataset, a
collection of over 45,000 research papers focused on COVID-19 research. The
system is publicly available at https://allenai.github.io/spike

    <title>Learn-Apply-Reinforce/Share Learning: Hackathons and CTFs as General
  Pedagogic Tools in Higher Education, and Their Applicability to Distance
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  This paper lays out two teaching/learning methods that are becoming
increasingly prevalent in computer science - hackathons, and Capture the Flag
(CTF) competitions - and the pedagogic theory that underpins them. A case study
of each is analysed, and the underpinning similarities extracted. The
frameworks are then generalised to Learn-Apply-Reinforce/Share Learning - a
social constructivistic method that can be used subject-independently. The
applicability of this new method to distance learning is then investigated -
with a mind to potential necessity to work from home - both due to increasing
demand in the Higher Education sector, but also the devastating impact of
crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, a few potential
extensions and future applications are discussed - including the possibilities
of pivoting the method to be more research-driven, or indeed, to drive
research.

    <title>Social Media and COVID-19: Can Social Distancing be Quantified without
  Measuring Human Movements?</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 outbreak has posed significant threats to international health
and the economy. In the absence of treatment for this virus, public health
officials asked the public to practice social distancing to reduce the number
of physical contacts. However, quantifying social distancing is a challenging
task and current methods are based on human movements. We propose a time and
cost-effective approach to measure how people practice social distancing. This
study proposes a new method based on utilizing the frequency of hashtags
supporting and encouraging social distancing for measuring social distancing.
We have identified 18 related hashtags and tracked their trends between Jan and
May 2020. Our evaluation results show that there is a strong correlation
(P&lt;0.05) between our findings and the Google social distancing report.

    <title>Activity-based contact network scaling and epidemic propagation in
  metropolitan areas</title>
    <summary>  Given the growth of urbanization and emerging pandemic threats, more
sophisticated models are required to understand disease propagation and
investigate the impacts of intervention strategies across various city types.
We introduce a fully mechanistic, activity-based and highly spatio-temporally
resolved epidemiological model which leverages on person-trajectories obtained
from integrated mobility demand and supply models in full-scale cities.
Simulating COVID-19 evolution in two full-scale cities with representative
synthetic populations and mobility patterns, we analyze activity-based contact
networks. We observe that transit contacts are scale-free in both cities, work
contacts are Weibull distributed, and shopping or leisure contacts are
exponentially distributed. We also investigate the impact of the transit
network, finding that its removal dampens disease propagation, while work is
also critical to post-peak disease spreading. Our framework, validated against
existing case and mortality data, demonstrates the potential for tracking and
tracing, along with detailed socio-demographic and mobility analyses of
epidemic control strategies.

    <title>Corona Games: Masks, Social Distance and Mechanism Design</title>
    <summary>  Pandemic response is a complex affair. Most governments employ a set of
quasi-standard measures to fight COVID-19 including wearing masks, social
distancing, virus testing and contact tracing. We argue that some non-trivial
factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish
decision-making and the differing national implementations of the response
mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the effect of
individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to wearing masks and
social distancing, and how these may result in a sub-optimal outcome. We also
demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games
properly regarding the chosen policies and their influence on the preferred
outcome. We promote a mechanism design approach: it is in the best interest of
every government to carefully balance social good and response costs when
implementing their respective pandemic response mechanism.

    <title>Targeted Pandemic Containment Through Identifying Local Contact Network
  Bottlenecks</title>
    <summary>  Decision-making about pandemic mitigation often relies upon mathematical
modelling. Models of contact networks are increasingly used for these purposes,
and are often appropriate for infections that spread from person to person.
Real-world human contact networks are rich in structural features that
influence infection transmission, such as tightly-knit local communities that
are weakly connected to one another. In this paper, we propose a new flow-based
edge-betweenness centrality method for detecting bottleneck edges that connect
communities in contact networks. In particular, we utilize convex optimization
formulations based on the idea of diffusion with $p$-norm network flow. Using
mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission through real network data at both
individual and county levels, we demonstrate that targeting bottleneck edges
identified by the proposed method reduces the number of infected cases by up to
$10\%$ more than state-of-the-art edge-betweenness methods. Furthermore, we
demonstrate empirically that the proposed method is orders of magnitude faster
than existing methods.

    <title>Catastrophic failure of outbreak containment: Limited testing causes
  discontinuity in epidemic transition</title>
    <summary>  Standard measures such as quarantining suspects and contact tracing could not
contain the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike for other recent epidemics where
such instruments were successful, in the present case a large fraction of the
infected have only mild unspecific symptoms. By employing network models we
here show that even for near perfect contact tracing and unlimited suspect
testing, containment starts to fail when more than approximately half of the
carriers fall into the weak-symptom category. The situation becomes
considerably more severe if the number of daily available tests is limited. In
this case the epidemic transition becomes discontinuous and a much larger
percentage of the population becomes infected. While moderate levels of social
distancing can bring the situation back under control, the limited number of
daily tests introduces a finite time horizon: If social distancing is
implemented after the cut off date, containment catastrophically breaks down
resulting in an exponential disease spread.

    <title>Modeling and Controlling the Spread of Epidemic with Various Social and
  Economic Scenarios</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel model for describing the spreading processes, in
particular, epidemics. Our model is an extension of the SIQR
(susceptible-infected-quarantine-recovered) and SIRP
(susceptible-infected-recovered-pathogen) models used earlier to describe
various scenarios of epidemic spread. As compared to the basic SIR model, our
model takes into account two possible routes of virus transmission: direct from
the infected compartment to the susceptible compartment and indirect via some
intermediate medium or fomites. The transmission rates are estimated in terms
of the average distances between the individuals in selected social
environments and characteristic relaxation times. We also introduce a resource
activation function that reflects the load of the epidemics on economics and
the limited capacity of the medical infrastructure. Our model brings an
advantage of building various control strategies to minimize the effect of the
epidemic and can be applied to modeling the recent COVID-19 outbreak.

    <title>Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics in the Host</title>
    <summary>  While many epidemiological models have being proposed to understand and
handle COVID-19, too little has been invested to understand how the virus
replicates in the human body and potential antiviral can be used to control the
replication cycle. In this work, using a control theoretical approach,
validated mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 in humans are properly
characterized. A complete analysis of the main dynamic characteristic is
developed based on the reproduction number. The equilibrium regions of the
system are fully characterized, and the stability of such a regions, formally
established. Mathematical analysis highlights critical conditions to decrease
monotonically SARS-CoV-2 in the host, such conditions are relevant to tailor
future antiviral treatments. Simulation results show the potential benefits of
the aforementioned system characterization.

    <title>Did lockdowns serve their purpose?</title>
    <summary>  We show that the dynamics of the number of deaths due to Covid in different
countries is to a large extent universal once the origin of time is chosen to
be the start of the lockdown, and the number of death is rescaled by the total
number of deaths after the lockdown, itself a proxy of the number of infections
at the start of the lockdown. Such a curve collapse is much less convincing
when normalizing by the total population. Sweden, with its no-lockdown,
light-touch approach, is the only outlier that deviates considerably from the
average behavior. We argue that these model-free findings provide strong
support for the effectiveness of the lockdowns in mitigating the lethality of
the virus.

    <title>Analysis of Virus Propagation: A Transition Model Representation of
  Stochastic Epidemiological Models</title>
    <summary>  The growing literature on the propagation of COVID-19 relies on various
dynamic SIR-type models (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) which yield
model-dependent results. For transparency and ease of comparing the results, we
introduce a common representation of the SIR-type stochastic epidemiological
models. This representation is a discrete time transition model, which allows
us to classify the epidemiological models with respect to the number of states
(compartments) and their interpretation. Additionally, the transition model
eliminates several limitations of the deterministic continuous time
epidemiological models which are pointed out in the paper. We also show that
all SIR-type models have a nonlinear (pseudo) state space representation and
are easily estimable from an extended Kalman filter.

    <title>Small Area Estimation of Health Outcomes</title>
    <summary>  Small area estimation (SAE) entails estimating characteristics of interest
for domains, often geographical areas, in which there may be few or no samples
available. SAE has a long history and a wide variety of methods have been
suggested, from a bewildering range of philosophical standpoints. We describe
design-based and model-based approaches and models that are specified at the
area-level and at the unit-level, focusing on health applications and fully
Bayesian spatial models. The use of auxiliary information is a key ingredient
for successful inference when response data are sparse and we discuss a number
of approaches that allow the inclusion of covariate data. SAE for HIV
prevalence, using data collected from a Demographic Health Survey in Malawi in
2015-2016, is used to illustrate a number of techniques. The potential use of
SAE techniques for outcomes related to COVID-19 is discussed.

    <title>NewsStand CoronaViz: A Map Query Interface for Spatio-Temporal and
  Spatio-Textual Monitoring of Disease Spread</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid continuing spread of COVID-19, it is clearly important to be
able to track the progress of the virus over time in order to be better
prepared to anticipate its emergence and spread in new regions as well as
declines in its presence in regions thereby leading to or justifying
"reopening" decisions. There are many applications and web sites that monitor
officially released numbers of cases which are likely to be the most accurate
methods for tracking the progress of the virus; however, they will not
necessarily paint a complete picture. To begin filling any gaps in official
reports, we have developed the NewsStand CoronaViz web application
(https://coronaviz.umiacs.io) that can run on desktops and mobile devices that
allows users to explore the geographic spread in discussions about the virus
through analysis of keyword prevalence in geotagged news articles and tweets in
relation to the real spread of the virus as measured by confirmed case numbers
reported by the appropriate authorities. NewsStand CoronaViz users have access
to dynamic variants of the disease-related variables corresponding to the
numbers of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recoveries (where they
are provided) via a map query interface. It has the ability to step forward and
backward in time using both a variety of temporal window sizes (day, week,
month, or combinations thereof) in addition to user-defined varying spatial
window sizes specified by direct manipulation actions (e.g., pan, zoom, and
hover) as well as textually (e.g., by the name of the containing country, state
or province, or county as well as textually-specified spatially-adjacent
combinations thereof), and finally by the amount of spatio-temporally-varying
news and tweet volume involving COVID-19.

    <title>COVID-19: Development of a Robust Mathematical Model and Simulation
  Package with Consideration for Ageing Population and Time Delay for Control
  Action and Resusceptibility</title>
    <summary>  The current global health emergency triggered by the pandemic COVID-19 is one
of the greatest challenges mankind face in this generation. Computational
simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the
current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future
projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control
action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a
well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral
diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola,
SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with
additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibility,
where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the
current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death,
recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also
considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time
delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as
well as resusceptibility with temporal immune response. Owing to huge
variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims
to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the
spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be
better understood. The model is verified using two case studies for
verification and prediction studies, based on the real-world data in South
Korea and Northern Ireland, respectively.

    <title>How to reduce epidemic peaks keeping under control the time-span of the
  epidemic</title>
    <summary>  One of the main challenges of the measures against the COVID-19 epidemic is
to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak without increasing without control
its timescale. We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic
dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak $I_P$ can be achieved only
at the price of increasing the time $t_P$ of its occurrence and its entire
time-span $t_E$. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the
equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in
the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale
and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate $\alpha$ and by
increasing the removal rate $\beta$ by a factor of $\lambda$. We show that for
a given value of the size ($I_P$, the total, $I_E$ and average $\hat I_P$
number of infected), its occurrence time $t_P$ and entire time-span $t_E$ can
be reduced by a factor $1/\lambda$ if the reduction of $I$ is achieved by
increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus,
epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by
prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on
social distancing. We apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern
Italy. We show that the peak time $t_P$ and the entire time span $t_E$ could
have been reduced by a factor $0.9 \le 1/\lambda\le 0.34$ with containment
measures focused on increasing $\beta$ instead of reducing $\alpha$.

    <title>Confinement strategies in a simple SIR model</title>
    <summary>  We propose a simple SIR model in order to investigate the impact of various
confinement strategies on a most virulent epidemic. Our approach is motivated
by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two
populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which
the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non
confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The
model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following
a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the
differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is
observed in the COVID-19 epidemic.
  Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our
model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by
just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn
out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it
became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of
all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a
rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second
epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the
scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a
progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the
progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too
different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise
exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major
part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but
obeying rigorous distancing constraints.

    <title>Medidas de distanciamento social e mobilidade na América do Sul
  durante a pandemia por COVID-19: Condições necessárias e suficientes?</title>
    <summary>  In a scenario where there is no vaccine for COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical
interventions are necessary to contain the spread of the virus and the collapse
of the health system in the affected regions. One of these measures is social
distancing, which aims to reduce interactions in the community by closing
public and private establishments that involve crowds of people. The lockdown
presupposes a drastic reduction in community interactions, representing a more
extreme measure of social distancing. Based on geolocation data provided by
Google for six categories of physical spaces, this article identifies the
variations in the circulation of people in South America for different types of
social distancing measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study,
population mobility trends for a group of countries between February 15, 2020
and May 16, 2020 were analyzed. To summarize these trends in a single metric, a
general circulation index was created, and to identify regional mobility
patterns, descriptive analyzes of spatial autocorrelation (global and local
Moran index) were used. The first hypothesis of this study is that countries
with a lockdown decree can achieve greater success in reducing the mobility of
the population, and the second hypothesis is that Argentina, Brazil and
Colombia have regional mobility patterns. The first hypothesis was partially
confirmed (considering 10 countries in South America), and the results obtained
in the spatial analyzes confirmed the second hypothesis. In general, the
observed data shows that less rigid lockdown or social distancing measures are
necessary, however, they are not sufficient to achieve a significant reduction
in the circulation of people during the pandemic.

    <title>Synthetic Interventions</title>
    <summary>  We develop a method to help quantify the impact different levels of mobility
restrictions could have had on COVID-19 related deaths across nations.
Synthetic control (SC) has emerged as a standard tool in such scenarios to
produce counterfactual estimates if a particular intervention had not occurred,
using just observational data. However, it remains an important open problem of
how to extend SC to obtain counterfactual estimates if a particular
intervention had occurred - this is exactly the question of the impact of
mobility restrictions stated above. As our main contribution, we introduce
synthetic interventions (SI), which helps resolve this open problem by allowing
one to produce counterfactual estimates if there are multiple interventions of
interest. We prove SI produces consistent counterfactual estimates under a
tensor factor model. Our finite sample analysis shows the test error decays as
$1/T_0$, where $T_0$ is the amount of observed pre-intervention data. As a
special case, this improves upon the $1/\sqrt{T_0}$ bound on test error for SC
in prior works. Our test error bound holds under a certain "subspace inclusion"
condition; we furnish a data-driven hypothesis test with provable guarantees to
check for this condition. This also provides a quantitative hypothesis test for
when to use SC, currently absent in the literature. Technically, we establish
the parameter estimation and test error for Principal Component Regression (a
key subroutine in SI and several SC variants) under the setting of
error-in-variable regression decays as $1/T_0$, where $T_0$ is the number of
samples observed; this improves the best prior test error bound of
$1/\sqrt{T_0}$. In addition to the COVID-19 case study, we show how SI can be
used to run data-efficient, personalized randomized control trials using real
data from a large e-commerce website and a large developmental economics study.

    <title>Large deviations of the realized (co-)volatility vector</title>
    <summary>  Realized statistics based on high frequency returns have become very popular
in financial economics. In recent years, different non-parametric estimators of
the variation of a log-price process have appeared. These were developed by
many authors and were motivated by the existence of complete records of price
data. Among them are the realized quadratic (co-)variation which is perhaps the
most well known example, providing a consistent estimator of the integrated
(co-)volatility when the logarithmic price process is continuous. Limit results
such as the weak law of large numbers or the central limit theorem have been
proved in different contexts. In this paper, we propose to study the large
deviation properties of realized (co-)volatility (i.e., when the number of high
frequency observations in a fixed time interval increases to infinity. More
specifically, we consider a bivariate model with synchronous observation
schemes and correlated Brownian motions of the following form: $dX\_{\ell,t} =
\sigma\_{\ell,t}dB\_{\ell,t}+b\_{\ell}(t,\omega)dt$ for $\ell=1,2$, where
$X\_{\ell}$ denotes the log-price, we are concerned with the large deviation
estimation of the vector $V\_t^n(X)=(Q\_{1,t}^n(X), Q\_{2,t}^n(X),
C\_{t}^n(X))$ where $Q\_{\ell,t}^n(X)$ and $C\_{t}^n(X)$ represente the
estimator of the quadratic variational processes
$Q\_{\ell,t}=\int\_0^t\sigma\_{\ell,s}^2ds$ and the integrated covariance
$C\_t=\int\_0^t\sigma\_{1,s}\sigma\_{2,s}\rho\_sds$ respectively, with
$\rho\_t=cov(B\_{1,t}, B\_{2,t})$. Our main motivation is to improve upon the
existing limit theorems. Our large deviations results can be used to evaluate
and approximate tail probabilities of realized (co-)volatility. As an
application we provide the large deviation for the standard dependence measures
between the two assets returns such as the realized regression coefficients up
to time $t$, or the realized correlation. Our study should contribute to the
recent trend of research on the (co-)variance estimation problems, which are
quite often discussed in high-frequency financial data analysis.

    <title>Real-time forecasts of the 2019-nCoV epidemic in China from February 5th
  to February 24th, 2020</title>
    <summary>  The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the 2019-nCoV
epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of
the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven
the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The ongoing outbreak presents a
challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth
trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus
are yet to be fully elucidated. We provide timely short-term forecasts of the
cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter
of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the
province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the
2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health
Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five
consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified
uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth
model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here
based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models
presented and suggest an average range of 7,409-7,496 additional cases in Hubei
and 1,128-1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days.
Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 -
38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 - 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020.
Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have
remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th -
9th). Our forecasts suggest that the containment strategies implemented in
China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has
slowed in recent days.

    <title>In silico comparison of spike protein-ACE2 binding affinities across
  species; significance for the possible origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus</title>
    <summary>  The devastating impact of the COVID19 pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus 2
(SARSCoV2) has raised important questions on the origins of this virus, the
mechanisms of any zoonotic transfer from exotic animals to humans, whether
companion animals or those used for commercial purposes can act as reservoirs
for infection, and the reasons for the large variations in susceptibilities
across animal species. Traditional lab-based methods will ultimately answer
many of these questions but take considerable time. In silico modeling methods
provide the opportunity to rapidly generate information on newly emerged
pathogens to aid countermeasure development and also to predict potential
future behaviors. We used a structural homology modeling approach to
characterize the SARSCoV2 spike protein and predict its binding strength to the
human ACE2 receptor. We then explored the possible transmission path by which
SARSCoV2 might have crossed to humans by constructing models of ACE2 receptors
of relevant species, and calculating the binding energy of SARSCoV2 spike
protein to each. Notably, SARSCoV2 spike protein had the highest overall
binding energy for human ACE2, greater than all the other tested species
including bat, the postulated source of the virus. This indicates that SARSCoV2
is a highly adapted human pathogen. Of the species studied, the next highest
binding affinity after human was pangolin, which is most likely explained by a
process of convergent evolution. Binding of SARSCoV2 for dog and cat ACE2 was
similar to affinity for bat ACE2, all being lower than for human ACE2, and is
consistent with only occasional observations of infections of these domestic
animals. Overall, the data indicates that SARSCoV2 is uniquely adapted to
infect humans, raising questions as to whether it arose in nature by a rare
chance event or whether its origins lie elsewhere.

    <title>Social Distancing as a Network Population Game in a Socially Connected
  World</title>
    <summary>  While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life
in today's ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much
public attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus
pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among
solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or
slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social
distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of
social sites, such as schools, restaurants, shopping centers, residential
areas, etc., decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing
down others so that the social contacts across the network can be minimized. We
model this problem as a network population game, where every individual tries
to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize all
his/her contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be found for every one,
when the resulting distribution of the population over the network reaches an
equilibrium. We show that a large class of equilibrium strategies can be
obtained by selecting a set of network sites that forms a so-called maximal
r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied network types, such
as the maximal independent set (r=0), the maximal strong matching (r=1), the
maximal set of independent cycles (r=2), etc. They are easy to identify or
construct, and can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict
isolation, or allow certain degree of connectivities (with r &gt; 0) for more
flexible distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies,
and analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular
subnetworks. We provide an overview on algorithms that can be used for
computing maximal r-regular subnetworks and their associated distancing
strategies.

    <title>A reductive analysis of a compartmental model for COVID-19: data
  assimilation and forecasting for the United Kingdom</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a deterministic model that partitions the total population into
the susceptible, infected, quarantined, and those traced after exposure, the
recovered and the deceased. We hypothesize 'accessible population for
transmission of the disease' to be a small fraction of the total population,
for instance when interventions are in force. This hypothesis, together with
the structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations
for the populations, allows us to decouple the equations into just two
equations. This further reduces to a logistic type of equation for the total
infected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore
allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms
of the parameters in the full model. The validity of the 'accessible
population' hypothesis and the efficacy of the reduced logistic model is
demonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the cumulative
infected and daily new infected cases. The model can also be used to forecast
further progression of the disease. In an effort to find optimized parameter
values compatible with the United Kingdom coronavirus data, we first determine
the relative importance of the various transition rates participating in the
original model. Using this we show that the original model equations provide a
very good fit with the United Kingdom data for the cumulative number of
infections and the daily new cases. The fact that the model calculated daily
new cases exhibits a turning point, suggests the beginning of a slow-down in
the spread of infections. However, since the rate of slowing down beyond the
turning point is small, the cumulative number of infections is likely to
saturate to about $3.52 \times 10^5$ around late July, provided the lock-down
conditions continue to prevail.

    <title>Optimal immunity control by social distancing for the SIR epidemic model</title>
    <summary>  Until a vaccine or therapy is found against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus,
reaching herd immunity appears to be the only mid-term option. However, if the
number of infected individuals decreases and eventually fades only beyond this
threshold, a significant proportion of susceptible may still be infected until
the epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in the
worst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number of
newly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strict
containment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remains
close to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment can
only last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article,
using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containment
strategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number of
susceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently that
minimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. The
existence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter is
fully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would lead
theoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on an
infinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitary
measures put in place in France from March to May 2020. We also analyze the
minimum intervention time to reach a fixed distance from herd immunity, and
show the relationship with the previous problem. Simulations are provided that
illustrate and validate the theoretical results.

    <title>Beyond $R_0$: Heterogeneity in secondary infections and probabilistic
  epidemic forecasting</title>
    <summary>  The basic reproductive number -- $R_0$ -- is one of the most common and most
commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Although often used to compare
outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity
that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $R_0$.
Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution
of secondary infections, leveraging both its average $R_0$ and the underlying
heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random
network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine
the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the
heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show
the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the
data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without
data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious
diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically.
Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing
during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $R_0$
when predicting epidemic size.

    <title>Contact Tracing Mobile Apps for COVID-19: Privacy Considerations and
  Related Trade-offs</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing is an essential tool for public health officials and local
communities to fight the spread of novel diseases, such as for the COVID-19
pandemic. The Singaporean government just released a mobile phone app,
TraceTogether, that is designed to assist health officials in tracking down
exposures after an infected individual is identified. However, there are
important privacy implications of the existence of such tracking apps. Here, we
analyze some of those implications and discuss ways of ameliorating the privacy
concerns without decreasing usefulness to public health. We hope in writing
this document to ensure that privacy is a central feature of conversations
surrounding mobile contact tracing apps and to encourage community efforts to
develop alternative effective solutions with stronger privacy protection for
the users. Importantly, though we discuss potential modifications, this
document is not meant as a formal research paper, but instead is a response to
some of the privacy characteristics of direct contact tracing apps like
TraceTogether and an early-stage Request for Comments to the community.

    <title>Self-isolation or borders closing: what prevents epidemic spreading
  better?</title>
    <summary>  Pandemic distribution of COVID-19 in the world has motivated us to discuss
combined effects of network clustering and adaptivity on epidemic spreading. We
address the question concerning the choice of optimal mechanism for most
effective prohibiting disease propagation in a connected network: adaptive
clustering, which mimics self-isolation (SI) in local communities, or sharp
instant clustering, which looks like frontiers closing (FC) between cities and
countries. SI-networks are "adaptively grown" under condition of maximization
of small cliques in the entire network, while FC-networks are "instantly
created". Running the standard SIR model on clustered SI- and FC-networks, we
demonstrate that the adaptive network clustering prohibits the epidemic
spreading better than the instant clustering in the network with similar
parameters. We found that SI model has scale-free property for degree
distribution $P(k)\sim k^{\eta}$ with small critical exponent $-2&lt;\eta&lt;-1$ and
argue that scale-free behavior emerges due to the randomness in the initial
degree distributions and is absent for random regular graphs.

    <title>Build-at-home UV-C disinfection system for healthcare settings</title>
    <summary>  Significant research has shown that UV-C exposure is an effective
disinfectant for a range of bacteria and viruses, including coronaviruses. As
such, a UV-C treatment in combination with a chemical wipe, such as EPA
hydrogen peroxide, is a common cleaning protocol in a medical setting, and such
disinfection protocols have gained in importance during the current COVID-19
pandemic due to the need to reuse PPE. However, given the substantial increase
in patient volume, the quantity of materials requiring disinfection exceeds the
UV-C equipment throughput capabilities at many medical facilities. Therefore,
there is a need for a UV-C disinfection system that can be rapidly deployed. In
response to this demand, we designed, constructed, and validated a UV-C
disinfection system from readily accessible components; specifically, a plastic
bin, UV-C light bulb and conventional light housing. To further improve the
performance, the interior of the tub was spray-painted with chrome paint,
forming a low quality-factor (Q) Fabry-Perot optical cavity. As part of this
work, a set of modular design criteria which allows for flexibility in
component selection without degradation of UV-C dose performance is
established. This flexibility is critical given the current fluctuating
availability of source materials. The disinfection capabilities of the system
are validated using Bacillus cereus, a gram-positive endospore-forming
bacteria.

    <title>Efficient Noise-Blind $\ell_1$-Regression of Nonnegative Compressible
  Signals</title>
    <summary>  In compressed sensing the goal is to recover a signal from as few as possible
noisy, linear measurements. The general assumption is that the signal has only
a few non-zero entries. Given an estimate for the noise level a common convex
approach to recover the signal is basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). If the
measurement matrix has the robust null space property with respect to the
$\ell_2$-norm, BPDN obeys stable and robust recovery guarantees. In the case of
unknown noise levels, nonnegative least squares recovers non-negative signals
if the measurement matrix fulfills an additional property (sometimes called the
$M^+$-criterion). However, if the measurement matrix is the biadjacency matrix
of a random left regular bipartite graph it obeys with a high probability the
null space property with respect to the $\ell_1$-norm with optimal parameters.
Therefore, we discuss non-negative least absolute deviation (NNLAD). For these
measurement matrices, we prove a uniform, stable and robust recovery guarantee.
Such guarantees are important, since binary expander matrices are sparse and
thus allow for fast sketching and recovery. We will further present a method to
solve the NNLAD numerically and show that this is comparable to state of the
art methods. Lastly, we explain how the NNLAD can be used for group testing in
the recent COVID-19 crisis and why contamination of specimens may be modeled as
peaky noise, which favors $\ell_1$ based data fidelity terms.

    <title>Accelerated infection testing at scale: a proposal for inference with
  single test on multiple patients</title>
    <summary>  In pandemics or epidemics, public health authorities need to rapidly test a
large number of individuals, both to determine the line of treatment as well as
to know the spread of infection to plan containment, mitigation and future
responses. However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck,
especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where
the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills
and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost
of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for
poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a
test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single
test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample
likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It
thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore,
requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat
increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two
patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test
kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.

    <title>Static vs accumulating priorities in healthcare queues under heavy loads</title>
    <summary>  Amid unprecedented times caused by COVID-19, healthcare systems all over the
world are strained to the limits of, or even beyond, capacity. A similar event
is experienced by some healthcare systems regularly, due to for instance
seasonal spikes in the number of patients. We model this as a queueing system
in heavy traffic (where the arrival rate is approaching the service rate from
below) or in overload (where the arrival rate exceeds the service rate). In
both cases we assume that customers (patients) may have different priorities
and we consider two popular service disciplines: static priorities and
accumulating priorities. It has been shown that the latter allows for patients
of all classes to be seen in a timely manner as long as the system is stable.
We demonstrate however that if accumulating priorities are used in the heavy
traffic or overload regime, then all patients, including those with the highest
priority, will experience very long waiting times. If on the other hand static
priorities are applied, then one can ensure that the highest-priority patients
will be seen in a timely manner even in overloaded systems.

    <title>Assessing Disease Exposure Risk with Location Data: A Proposal for
  Cryptographic Preservation of Privacy</title>
    <summary>  Governments and researchers around the world are implementing digital contact
tracing solutions to stem the spread of infectious disease, namely COVID-19.
Many of these solutions threaten individual rights and privacy. Our goal is to
break past the false dichotomy of effective versus privacy-preserving contact
tracing. We offer an alternative approach to assess and communicate users' risk
of exposure to an infectious disease while preserving individual privacy. Our
proposal uses recent GPS location histories, which are transformed and
encrypted, and a private set intersection protocol to interface with a
semi-trusted authority.
  There have been other recent proposals for privacy-preserving contact
tracing, based on Bluetooth and decentralization, that could further eliminate
the need for trust in authority. However, solutions with Bluetooth are
currently limited to certain devices and contexts while decentralization adds
complexity. The goal of this work is two-fold: we aim to propose a
location-based system that is more privacy-preserving than what is currently
being adopted by governments around the world, and that is also practical to
implement with the immediacy needed to stem a viral outbreak.

    <title>Inside the Mind of a Stock Market Crash</title>
    <summary>  We analyze how investor expectations about economic growth and stock returns
changed during the February-March 2020 stock market crash induced by the
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during the subsequent partial stock market
recovery. We surveyed retail investors who are clients of Vanguard at three
points in time: (i) on February 11-12, around the all-time stock market high,
(ii) on March 11-12, after the stock market had collapsed by over 20\%, and
(iii) on April 16-17, after the market had rallied 25\% from its lowest point.
Following the crash, the average investor turned more pessimistic about the
short-run performance of both the stock market and the real economy. Investors
also perceived higher probabilities of both further extreme stock market
declines and large declines in short-run real economic activity. In contrast,
investor expectations about long-run (10-year) economic and stock market
outcomes remained largely unchanged, and, if anything, improved. Disagreement
among investors about economic and stock market outcomes also increased
substantially following the stock market crash, with the disagreement
persisting through the partial market recovery. Those respondents who were the
most optimistic in February saw the largest decline in expectations, and sold
the most equity. Those respondents who were the most pessimistic in February
largely left their portfolios unchanged during and after the crash.

    <title>Pandemic Populism: Facebook Pages of Alternative News Media and the
  Corona Crisis -- A Computational Content Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has not only had severe political, economic, and
societal effects, it has also affected media and communication systems in
unprecedented ways. While traditional journalistic media has tried to adapt to
the rapidly evolving situation, alternative news media on the Internet have
given the events their own ideological spin. Such voices have been criticized
for furthering societal confusion and spreading potentially dangerous "fake
news" or conspiracy theories via social media and other online channels. The
current study analyzes the factual basis of such fears in an initial
computational content analysis of alternative news media's output on Facebook
during the early Corona crisis, based on a large German data set from January
to the second half of March 2020. Using computational content analysis,
methods, reach, interactions, actors, and topics of the messages were examined,
as well as the use of fabricated news and conspiracy theories. The analysis
revealed that the alternative news media stay true to message patterns and
ideological foundations identified in prior research. While they do not spread
obvious lies, they are predominantly sharing overly critical, even
anti-systemic messages, opposing the view of the mainstream news media and the
political establishment. With this pandemic populism, they contribute to a
contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, as portrayed in detail in
this analysis.

    <title>Robustness analysis in an inter-cities mobility network: modeling
  municipal, state and federal initiatives as failures and attacks</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the challenge related to the COVID-19 epidemic and the seek for
optimal containment strategies, we present a robustness analysis into an
inter-cities mobility complex network. We abstract municipal initiatives as
nodes' failures and the federal actions as targeted attacks. The geo(graphs)
approach is applied to visualize the geographical graph and produce maps of
topological indexes, such as degree and vulnerability. A Brazilian data of 2016
is considered a case study, with more than five thousand cities and
twenty-seven states. Based on the Network Robustness index, we show that the
most efficient attack strategy shifts from a topological degree-based, for the
all cities network, to a topological vulnerability-based, for a network
considering the Brazilian States as nodes. Moreover, our results reveal that
individual municipalities' actions do not cause a high impact on mobility
restrain since they tend to be punctual and disconnected to the country scene
as a whole. Oppositely, the coordinated isolation of specific cities is key to
detach entire network areas and thus prevent a spreading process to prevail.

    <title>Epidemics with containment measures</title>
    <summary>  We propose a Susceptible-Infected (SI) epidemic spreading model including
containment measures. In absence of containment measures the epidemics spreads
exponentially fast for any value of the infectivity $\lambda&gt;0$. The
containment measures are modeled by considering a time-dependent modulation of
the bare infectivity $\lambda$ leading to an effective infectivity that decays
in time for each infected individual, mimicking for instance the combined
effect of asymptomatic onset of the disease, testing policies and quarantine.
We consider a wide range of temporal kernels for the effective infectivity and
we investigate the effect of the considered containment measures. We find that
not all kernels are able to push the epidemic dynamics below the epidemic
threshold, with some containment measures only able to reduce the rate of the
exponential growth of new infected individuals. We also propose a model with
pandemic caused by a growing number of new separated foci. This model provides
a stylized mathematical framework that can shed light on the role of different
containment measures in mitigating and suppressing the spread of an epidemics
such as COVID-19.

    <title>Estimating the impact of preventive quarantine with reverse epidemiology</title>
    <summary>  The impact of mitigation or control measures on an epidemics can be estimated
by fitting the parameters of a compartmental model to empirical data, and
running the model forward with modified parameters that account for a specific
measure. This approach has several drawbacks, stemming from biases or lack of
availability of data and instability of parameter estimates. Here we take the
opposite approach -- that we call reverse epidemiology. Given the data, we
reconstruct backward in time an ensemble of networks of contacts, and we assess
the impact of measures on that specific realization of the contagion process.
This approach is robust because it only depends on parameters that describe the
evolution of the disease within one individual (e.g. latency time) and not on
parameters that describe the spread of the epidemics in a population. Using
this method, we assess the impact of preventive quarantine on the ongoing
outbreak of Covid-19 in Italy. This gives an estimate of how many infected
could have been avoided had preventive quarantine been enforced at a given
time.

    <title>Implications of the virus-encoded miRNA and host miRNA in the
  pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread worldwide
and has caused over 1,400,000 infections and 80,000 deaths. There are currently
no drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy for its prevention and little
knowledge was known about the pathogenicity mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Previous studies showed both virus and host-derived MicroRNAs (miRNAs) played
crucial roles in the pathology of virus infection. In this study, we use
computational approaches to scan the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNAs and
predict the virus miRNA targets on virus and human genome as well as the host
miRNAs targets on virus genome. Furthermore, we explore miRNAs involved
dysregulation caused by the virus infection. Our results implicated that the
immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable
biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Impressively,
we found hsa-miR-4661-3p was predicted to target the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, and
a virus-encoded miRNA MR147-3p could enhance the expression of TMPRSS2 with the
function of strengthening SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gut. The study may
provide important clues for the mechisms of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

    <title>CONTAIN: Privacy-oriented Contact Tracing Protocols for Epidemics</title>
    <summary>  Pandemic and epidemic diseases such as CoVID-19, SARS-CoV2, and Ebola have
spread to multiple countries and infected thousands of people. Such diseases
spread mainly through person-to-person contacts. Health care authorities
recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast
population. Although several mobile applications have been developed to trace
contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information
such as GPS locations, and the logging of privacy-sensitive data on a third
party server, or require additional infrastructure such as WiFi APs with known
locations. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, a privacy-oriented mobile
contact tracing application that does not rely on GPS or any other form of
infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of any other
personally identifiable information on a server. The goal of CONTAIN is to
allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short
distance, specifically, Bluetooth wireless range, of someone that is infected,
and potentially also when. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees
provided by our approach. Our simulation study utilizing an empirical trace
dataset (Asturies) involving 100 mobile devices and around 60000 records shows
that users can maximize their possibility of identifying if they were near an
infected user by turning on the app during active times.

    <title>Digital Ariadne: Citizen Empowerment for Epidemic Control</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 crisis represents the most dangerous threat to public health
since the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 1918. So far, the disease due to the
SARS-CoV-2 virus has been countered with extreme measures at national level
that attempt to suppress epidemic growth. However, these approaches require
quick adoption and enforcement in order to effectively curb virus spread, and
may cause unprecedented socio-economic impact. A viable alternative to mass
surveillance and rule enforcement is harnessing collective intelligence by
means of citizen empowerment. Mobile applications running on personal devices
could significantly support this kind of approach by exploiting
context/location awareness and data collection capabilities. In particular,
technology-assisted location and contact tracing, if broadly adopted, may help
limit the spread of infectious diseases by raising end-user awareness and
enabling the adoption of selective quarantine measures. In this paper, we
outline general requirements and design principles of personal applications for
epidemic containment running on common smartphones, and we present a tool,
called 'diAry' or 'digital Ariadne', based on voluntary location and Bluetooth
tracking on personal devices, supporting a distributed query system that
enables fully anonymous, privacy-preserving contact tracing. We look forward to
comments, feedback, and further discussion regarding contact tracing solutions
for pandemic containment.

    <title>COVID-19: $R_0$ is lower where outbreak is larger</title>
    <summary>  We use daily data from Lombardy, the Italian region most affected by the
COVID-19 outbreak, to calibrate a SIR model individually on each municipality.
These are all covered by the same health system and, in the post-lockdown phase
we focus on, all subject to the same social distancing regulations. We find
that municipalities with a higher number of cases at the beginning of the
period analyzed have a lower rate of diffusion, which cannot be imputed to herd
immunity. In particular, there is a robust and strongly significant negative
correlation between the estimated basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and the
initial outbreak size, in contrast with the role of $R_0$ as a \emph{predictor}
of outbreak size. We explore different possible explanations for this
phenomenon and conclude that a higher number of cases causes changes of
behavior, such as a more strict adoption of social distancing measures among
the population, that reduce the spread. This result calls for a transparent,
real-time distribution of detailed epidemiological data, as such data affects
the behavior of populations in areas affected by the outbreak.

    <title>Beyond just "flattening the curve": Optimal control of epidemics with
  purely non-pharmaceutical interventions</title>
    <summary>  When effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available,
non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, home quarantine and
far-reaching shutdown of public life are the only available strategies to
prevent the spread of epidemics. Based on an extended SEIR model and
continuous-time optimal control theory, in this paper the optimal
non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy is presented for the case that a
vaccine is never found and complete containment (eradication of the epidemic)
is impossible. In this case, the optimal control must meet competing
requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and, second,
the establishment of a sufficient degree of natural immunity at the end of the
measures, in order to exclude a second wave. Moreover, the socio-economic costs
of the intervention shall be kept at a minimum. The numerically computed
optimal control strategy is a single-intervention scenario that goes beyond
heuristically motivated interventions and simple "flattening of the curve".
Careful analysis of the resulting evolution of the time-dependent effective
reproduction number reveals, however, that the obtained solution is in fact a
tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, where
socio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balanced
against one another. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial
exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Germany.

    <title>LinearDesign: Efficient Algorithms for Optimized mRNA Sequence Design</title>
    <summary>  A messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising direction to combat
the current COVID-19 pandemic. This requires an mRNA sequence that is stable
and highly productive in protein expression, features which have been shown to
benefit from greater mRNA secondary structure folding stability and optimal
codon usage. However, sequence design remains a hard problem due to the
exponentially many synonymous mRNA sequences that encode the same protein. We
show that this design problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal
language theory and computational linguistics that can be solved in O(n^3)
time, where n is the mRNA sequence length. This algorithm could still be too
slow for large n (e.g., n = 3, 822 nucleotides for the spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2), so we further developed a linear-time approximate version,
LinearDesign, inspired by our recent work, LinearFold. This algorithm,
LinearDesign, can compute the approximate minimum free energy mRNA sequence for
this spike protein in just 11 minutes using beam size b = 1, 000, with only
0.6% loss in free energy change compared to exact search (i.e., b = +infinity,
which costs 1 hour). We also develop two algorithms for incorporating the codon
optimality into the design, one based on k-best parsing to find alternative
sequences and one directly incorporating codon optimality into the dynamic
programming. Our work provides efficient computational tools to speed up and
improve mRNA vaccine development.

    <title>Disease spreading with social distancing: a prevention strategy in
  disordered multiplex networks</title>
    <summary>  The continue emerging of diseases that have the potential to become threats
at local and global scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and
COVID-19, makes it relevant to keep designing models of disease propagation and
strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects in populations. Since isolated
systems are very rare to find in any context, specially in human contact
networks, here we examine the susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease
spreading in a multiplex network formed by two distinct networks or layers that
are interconnected through a fraction $q$ of shared individuals. We model the
interactions between individuals in each layer through a weighted network,
because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or disordered); weights
represent the contact times of these interactions and we use a distribution of
contact times to assign an individual disorder to each layer. Using branching
theory supported by simulations, we study a social distancing strategy where we
reduce the average contact time in one layer (or in both of them, if
necessary). We find a set of disorder parameters - associated with average
contact times - that prevents a disease from becoming an epidemic. When the
disease is very likely to spread, the system is always in an epidemic phase,
regardless of the disorder parameters and the fraction of shared nodes. However
we find that it is still possible to protect a giant component of susceptible
individuals, which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system composed
by the two interconnected layers.

    <title>Visible Insights of the Invisible Pandemic: A Scientometric, Altmetric
  and Topic Trend Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The recent SARS-COV-2 virus outbreak has created an unprecedented global
health crisis! The disease is showing alarming trends with the number of people
getting infected with this disease, new cases and death rate are all
highlighting the need to control this disease at the earliest. The strategy now
for the governments around the globe is how to limit the spread of the virus
until the research community develops treatment/drug or vaccination against the
virus. The outbreak of this disease has unsurprisingly led to huge volume of
research within a short period of time surrounding this disease. It has also
led to aggressive social media activity on twitter, Facebook, dedicated blogs,
news reports and other online sites actively involved in discussing about the
various aspects of and related to this disease. It becomes a useful and
challenging exercise to draw from this huge volume of research, the key papers
that form the research front, its influence in the research community, and
other important research insights. Similarly, it becomes important to discern
the key issues that influence the society concerning this disease. The paper is
motivated by this. It attempts to distinguish which are the most influential
papers, the key knowledge base and major topics surrounding the research
covered by COVID-19. Further it attempts to capture the society's perception by
discerning key topics that are trending online. The study concludes by
highlighting the implications of this study.

    <title>Control with uncertain data of socially structured compartmental
  epidemic models</title>
    <summary>  The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic
peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical
compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the
effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In
addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of
uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we
address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the
epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of
the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the
control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models
capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term
interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of
the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The
importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly
relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected
people. Simulations related to data from the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy
are presented and discussed.

    <title>A feedback SIR (fSIR) model highlights advantages and limitations of
  infection-based social distancing</title>
    <summary>  Transmission rates in epidemic outbreaks vary over time depending on the
societal and government response to infections and mortality data, as evidenced
in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a mean field approach that
models individuals like molecules in a well-mixed solution, I derive a modified
SIR model in which the average daily contacts between susceptible and infected
population are reduced based on the known infection levels, capturing the
effects of social distancing policies. This approach yields a time-varying
reproduction number that is continuously adjusted based on infection
information through a negative-feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type
II functions in ecology and Hill functions in chemistry and molecular biology.
This feedback-adjustment of the transmission rate causes a structural reduction
in infection peak, and simulations indicate that such reduction persists even
in the presence of information delays. Simulations also show that a distancing
policy based on infection data may substantially extend the duration of an
epidemic. If the distancing rate is linearly proportional to infections, this
model adds a single parameter to the original SIR, making it useful to
illustrate the effects of social distancing enforced based on awareness of
infections.

    <title>Epione: Lightweight Contact Tracing with Strong Privacy</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing is an essential tool in containing infectious diseases such
as COVID-19. Many countries and research groups have launched or announced
mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users
with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random
tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users'
phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to
learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been
diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end
privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these
approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token
metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users.
  In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing
with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their
contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of
users' contacts from both central services and other users, and provides
protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new
cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality
(PSI-CA), which allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the
intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We
specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients
have small input sets and the server's database of tokens is much larger.

    <title>Project 1000 x 1000: Centrifugal melt spinning for distributed
  manufacturing of N95 filtering facepiece respirators</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global shortage of personal protective
equipment. While existing supply chains are struggling to meet the surge in
demand, the limited supply of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has
placed healthcare workers at risk. This paper presents a method for scalable
and distributed manufacturing of FFR filter material based on a combination of
centrifugal melt spinning utilizing readily available cotton candy machines as
an example. The proposed method produces nonwoven polypropylene fabric material
with filtering efficiency of up to 96% for particles 0.30-0.49 {\mu}m in
diameter. We additionally demonstrate a scalable means to test for filtration
efficiency and pressure drop to ensure a standardized degree of quality in the
output material. We perform preliminary optimization of relevant parameters for
scale-up and propose that this is a viable method to rapidly produce up to one
million N95 FFRs per day in distributed manner with just six machines per site
operating across 200 locations. We share this work as a starting point for
others to rapidly construct, replicate and develop their own affordable modular
processes aimed at producing high quality filtration material to address the
current FFR shortage globally.

    <title>Clinical concepts might be included in health-related mathematic models</title>
    <summary>  The construction of mathematical models that allow comprehensive approach of
decision-making in situations of absence of robust evidence is important. While
it is interesting to use models that are easy to understand, using values of
direct interpretation, we analized a published index (COVID-19 Burden Index)
and found it seems to be oversimplified. It is possible that the proposed
index, with current data, could be useful in geographically and
administratively narrowed places. But it is inaccurate to be applied throughout
the process and in places as broad as American countries. It would be ideal to
correct and refine the referred model, bearing in mind clinical concepts
described, to take advantage of the proposal and generate a more accurate
response, which can serve as an input both in the implementation of measures
and in the prediction of the behavior of a pandemic like the current one.
However, what we propose is to improve the accuracy of the model in terms of
quantities and applicability, agreeing with the concept of "stay at home". The
approach between complementary areas of knowledge should be the door that we
must open to generate the new evidence we need. Mathematics should not dispense
clinical sciences.

    <title>Recharging improves efficiency of decontaminated N95 masks</title>
    <summary>  N95 masks form a critical part of the personal protective equipment used by
frontline health-care workers, and are typically meant for one-time usage.
However, the recent COVID pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these
masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re-use
procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of N95
masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene
electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic
effects. This charge degrades quickly when the mask is used. Moreover, simple
decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) immediately degrade any
remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration
efficiency post decontamination. In this brief report, we summarize preliminary
results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of
charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. We show how the charge on the
mask changes due to decontamination treatments, and correlate with reduced
filtration efficiency. Additionally, we propose and show that it is possible to
recharge the masks post-decontamination treatment and recover filtration
efficiency. Importantly, recharging can be performed using readily available
equipment and materials, and so can be employed both in urban and rural
settings. We emphasize that because of the current worldwide lockdown, the
measurements reported in this report are preliminary, performed with hastily
constructed home-built equipment on a small variety of masks available to us.
Although we are confident in our results, we encourage groups with
special-purpose equipment to redo and verify our experiments.

    <title>Impacts of California Proposition 47 on Crime in Santa Monica, CA</title>
    <summary>  We examine crime patterns in Santa Monica, California before and after
passage of Proposition 47, a 2014 initiative that reclassified some non-violent
felonies to misdemeanors. We also study how the 2016 opening of four new light
rail stations, and how more community-based policing starting in late 2018,
impacted crime. A series of statistical analyses are performed on reclassified
(larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen
property) and non-reclassified crimes by probing publicly available databases
from 2006 to 2019. We compare data before and after passage of Proposition 47,
city-wide and within eight neighborhoods. Similar analyses are conducted within
a 450 meter radius of the new transit stations. Reports of monthly reclassified
crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition
47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the
largest overall surge. The reported incidence of larceny intensified throughout
the city. Two new train stations, including Downtown, reported significant
crime increases in their vicinity after service began. While the number of
reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, those
not affected by the new law decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that
Proposition 47 strongly impacted crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes
decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new policing measures
that enhanced outreach and patrolling. These findings may be relevant to law
enforcement and policy-makers. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term
trends may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed
societal conditions.

    <title>Virus Dynamics with Behavioral Responses</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by epidemics such as COVID-19, we study the spread of a contagious
disease when people change their behavior to respond to the disease prevalence.
We extend the SIR epidemiological model to include endogenous meeting rates.
Individuals benefit from economic activity, but higher activity also leads to
more interactions with potentially infected individuals. The main focus is a
theoretical analysis of the contagion dynamics with a population of optimizing
agents reacting myopically to the current disease prevalence. In the leading
case, the infection prevalence is single-peaked. We obtain a simple condition
for when several types of public-health interventions or changes in disease
prevalence will paradoxically increase infection rates due to risk
compensation. This condition implies that behavioral responses are most likely
to undermine public-health interventions near the peak of severe diseases. We
also derive an explicit formula for the behavior of a heterogeneous population.
A key difference from the homogeneous case is that high-risk individuals may
choose to temporarily stop all activity when they are likely to encounter
infected low-risk individuals.

    <title>Propagation of epidemics along lines with fast diffusion</title>
    <summary>  It has long been known that epidemics can travel along communication lines,
such as roads. In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that
major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple
model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a
quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical $SIR$ model with
diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected
individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between
individuals on the line and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A
classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system
analogous to one we had previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement
of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence
of a minimal spreading speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when
the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to $1$. More subtle qualitative
features of the final state, showing the important influence of the line, are
also proved here.

    <title>In-store epidemic behavior: scale development and validation</title>
    <summary>  Epidemics of infectious diseases have accompanied humans for a long time and,
depending on the scale, cause various undesirable social and economic
consequences. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many
countries impose restrictions to inhibit spreading of infection. Isolation and
limiting interpersonal contacts are particularly recommended actions. Adhering
to the rule of isolation may involve restrictions in freedom during daily
activities, such as shopping. The aim of the study was to develop a scale of
in-store pandemic behavior. The whole process involved 3 stages: qualitative
inquiry, scale purification and scale validation, which were based on 3
studies: 1 qualitative (20 in-depth interviews) 2 two quantitative (373 and 584
respondents, respectively), and allowed to identify 8 factors. Following, a
theoretical model was created to investigate the impact of in-store infection
threat on identified variables. All identified factors significantly correlated
with the in-store infection threat which reiterates the importance of providing
information revealing the true scale of the pandemic and not leaving space for
individuals to create subjective probability judgments. The developed scale can
help counteract disinformation and assess consumer behavior compliance and
understanding of the official recommendations imposed by governments, enabling
more efficient educational efforts.

    <title>Enabling and Emerging Technologies for Social Distancing: A
  Comprehensive Survey</title>
    <summary>  Social distancing is crucial for preventing the spread of viral diseases
illnesses such as COVID-19. By minimizing the closely physical contact between
people, we can reduce chances of catching the virus and spreading it to the
community. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on how emerging
technologies, e.g., wireless and networking, AI can enable, encourage, and even
enforce social distancing. To that end, we provide a fundamental background of
social distancing including basic concepts, measurements, models and propose
practical scenarios. We then discuss enabling wireless technologies which are
especially effective and can be widely adopted in practice to keep distance and
monitor people. After that, emerging technologies such as machine learning,
computer vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies
open many new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social
distancing, e.g., symptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined
people, and contact tracing. Finally, we provide important open issues and
challenges (e.g., privacy-preserving, cybersecurity) in implementing social
distancing in practice.

    <title>Adaptive Invariance for Molecule Property Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Effective property prediction methods can help accelerate the search for
COVID-19 antivirals either through accurate in-silico screens or by effectively
guiding on-going at-scale experimental efforts. However, existing prediction
tools have limited ability to accommodate scarce or fragmented training data
currently available. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learn
predictors that can generalize or extrapolate beyond the heterogeneous data.
Our method builds on and extends recently proposed invariant risk minimization,
adaptively forcing the predictor to avoid nuisance variation. We achieve this
by continually exercising and manipulating latent representations of molecules
to highlight undesirable variation to the predictor. To test the method we use
a combination of three data sources: SARS-CoV-2 antiviral screening data,
molecular fragments that bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease and large screening
data for SARS-CoV-1. Our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art transfer
learning methods by significant margin. We also report the top 20 predictions
of our model on Broad drug repurposing hub.

    <title>Detecting East Asian Prejudice on Social Media</title>
    <summary>  The outbreak of COVID-19 has transformed societies across the world as
governments tackle the health, economic and social costs of the pandemic. It
has also raised concerns about the spread of hateful language and prejudice
online, especially hostility directed against East Asia. In this paper we
report on the creation of a classifier that detects and categorizes social
media posts from Twitter into four classes: Hostility against East Asia,
Criticism of East Asia, Meta-discussions of East Asian prejudice and a neutral
class. The classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 across all four classes. We
provide our final model (coded in Python), as well as a new 20,000 tweet
training dataset used to make the classifier, two analyses of hashtags
associated with East Asian prejudice and the annotation codebook. The
classifier can be implemented by other researchers, assisting with both online
content moderation processes and further research into the dynamics, prevalence
and impact of East Asian prejudice online during this global pandemic.

    <title>EXPOSED: An occupant exposure model for confined spaces to retrofit
  crowd models during a pandemic</title>
    <summary>  Crowd models can be used for the simulation of people movement in the built
environment. Crowd model outputs have been used for evaluating safety and
comfort of pedestrians, inform crowd management and perform forensic
investigations. Microscopic crowd models allow the representation of each
person and the obtainment of information concerning their location over time
and interactions with the physical space/other people. Pandemics such as
COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of
disease transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling
can be used to assess occupant exposure in confined spaces. The policies
adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a pandemic can
vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the
spread of disease rather than a safety assessment performed at a building
level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in
buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment
is performed by retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure
assessment which can account for different types of disease transmissions. This
work allows policy makers to perform informed decisions concerning building
usage during a pandemic.

    <title>Strategic Spatiotemporal Vaccine Distribution Halves Deaths due to an
  Infectious Disease</title>
    <summary>  Covid-19 has caused hundred of thousands of deaths and an economic damage
amounting to trillions of dollars, creating a desire for the rapid development
of vaccine. Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question
on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely
focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk
groups), here we propose a generic strategy for their distribution in time and
space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection
growth rate. To demonstrate this strategy, we develop an agent-based model
describing the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to
vaccination. For heterogeneous infection patterns, the proposed strategy at
least halves the number of deaths in our simulations compared to the standard
practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density.
This applies for a wide range of reproduction numbers and vaccine production
rates and might stimulate discussions on the importance of the spatiotemporal
distribution of vaccines for official guidelines.

    <title>PriLok: Citizen-protecting distributed epidemic tracing</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing is an important instrument for national health services to
fight epidemics. As part of the COVID-19 situation, many proposals have been
made for scaling up contract tracing capacities with the help of smartphone
applications, an important but highly critical endeavor due to the privacy
risks involved in such solutions. Extending our previously expressed concern,
we clearly articulate in this article, the functional and non-functional
requirements that any solution has to meet, when striving to serve, not mere
collections of individuals, but the whole of a nation, as required in face of
such potentially dangerous epidemics. We present a critical information
infrastructure, PriLock, a fully-open preliminary architecture proposal and
design draft for privacy preserving contact tracing, which we believe can be
constructed in a way to fulfill the former requirements. Our architecture
leverages the existing regulated mobile communication infrastructure and builds
upon the concept of "checks and balances", requiring a majority of independent
players to agree to effect any operation on it, thus preventing abuse of the
highly sensitive information that must be collected and processed for efficient
contact tracing. This is enforced with a largely decentralised layout and
highly resilient state-of-the-art technology, which we explain in the paper,
finishing by giving a security, dependability and resilience analysis, showing
how it meets the defined requirements, even while the infrastructure is under
attack.

    <title>Modeling the spread of infectious disease in urban areas with travel
  contagion</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we develop the mathematical model to understand the coupling
between the spreading dynamics of infectious diseases and the mobility dynamics
through urban transportation systems. We first describe the mobility dynamics
of the urban population as the process of leaving from home, traveling to and
from the activity locations, and engaging in activities. We then embed the
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) process over the mobility
dynamics and develops the spatial SEIR model with travel contagion
(Trans-SEIR), which explicitly accounts for contagions both during travel and
during daily activities. We investigate the theoretical properties of the
proposed model and show how activity contagion and travel contagion contribute
to the average number of secondary infections. In the numerical experiments, we
explore how the urban transportation system may alter the fundamental dynamics
of the infectious disease, change the number of secondary infections, promote
the synchronization of the disease across the city, and affect the peak of the
disease outbreaks. The Trans-SEIR model is further applied to the understand
the disease dynamics during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City, where we
show how the activity and travel contagion may be distributed and how effective
travel control can be implemented with only limited resources. The Trans-SEIR
model along with the findings in our study may have significant contributions
to improving our understanding of the coupling between urban transportation and
disease dynamics, the development of quarantine and control measures of disease
system, and promoting the idea of disease-resilient urban transportation
networks.

    <title>Should the rate term in the basic epidemiology models be second-order?</title>
    <summary>  Global leaders are taking unprecendented steps with long-term financial and
societal impact to prevent the spread of COVID-19, relying on early data and
epidemiological models of differing complexity. The standard "compartment"
models of the spread of disease through a population follow the law of mass
action; that is, the rate of conversion of individuals from one compartment to
another is directly proportional to the number of individuals in the former.
The basic S-I-R model, which tracks susceptible, infectious, and recovered
people, is functionally identical to autocatalytic reactions studied in
chemical kinetics. However, if we account for heterogeneity in individuals'
susceptibility to catch the disease, then the most susceptible individuals are
likely to be removed from the pool early; this is analogous to evaporative
cooling in chemical kinetics. Here, we use standard tools from statistical
physics to account for this effect, which suggest that the rate of appearance
of new cases should be proportional to the \emph{square} of the number of
susceptible people in the population, not the first power. We validate this
finding with both Monte Carlo (stochastic) and many-compartment differential
equation (deterministic) simulations. This leads to quite different predictions
of the peak infection rate and final outbreak size, with the second-order model
giving milder predictions of each. This has dramatic effects on the
extrapolation of a disease's progression when the data collected comes from the
early, exponential-like region, and may remove a systematic bias from such
models.

    <title>Prta: A System to Support the Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the
  News</title>
    <summary>  Recent events, such as the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, Brexit and the
COVID-19 "infodemic", have brought into the spotlight the dangers of online
disinformation. There has been a lot of research focusing on fact-checking and
disinformation detection. However, little attention has been paid to the
specific rhetorical and psychological techniques used to convey propaganda
messages. Revealing the use of such techniques can help promote media literacy
and critical thinking, and eventually contribute to limiting the impact of
"fake news" and disinformation campaigns. Prta (Propaganda Persuasion
Techniques Analyzer) allows users to explore the articles crawled on a regular
basis by highlighting the spans in which propaganda techniques occur and to
compare them on the basis of their use of propaganda techniques. The system
further reports statistics about the use of such techniques, overall and over
time, or according to filtering criteria specified by the user based on time
interval, keywords, and/or political orientation of the media. Moreover, it
allows users to analyze any text or URL through a dedicated interface or via an
API. The system is available online: https://www.tanbih.org/prta

    <title>CrisisBERT: a Robust Transformer for Crisis Classification and
  Contextual Crisis Embedding</title>
    <summary>  Classification of crisis events, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks
and pandemics, is a crucial task to create early signals and inform relevant
parties for spontaneous actions to reduce overall damage. Despite crisis such
as natural disasters can be predicted by professional institutions, certain
events are first signaled by civilians, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemics.
Social media platforms such as Twitter often exposes firsthand signals on such
crises through high volume information exchange over half a billion tweets
posted daily. Prior works proposed various crisis embeddings and classification
using conventional Machine Learning and Neural Network models. However, none of
the works perform crisis embedding and classification using state of the art
attention-based deep neural networks models, such as Transformers and
document-level contextual embeddings. This work proposes CrisisBERT, an
end-to-end transformer-based model for two crisis classification tasks, namely
crisis detection and crisis recognition, which shows promising results across
accuracy and f1 scores. The proposed model also demonstrates superior
robustness over benchmark, as it shows marginal performance compromise while
extending from 6 to 36 events with only 51.4% additional data points. We also
proposed Crisis2Vec, an attention-based, document-level contextual embedding
architecture for crisis embedding, which achieve better performance than
conventional crisis embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GloVe. To the best
of our knowledge, our works are first to propose using transformer-based crisis
classification and document-level contextual crisis embedding in the
literature.

    <title>Mean-Field Game Analysis of SIR Model with Social Distancing</title>
    <summary>  As the current COVID-19 outbreak shows, disease epidemic is a complex problem
which must be tackled with the right public policy. One of the main tools of
the policymakers is to control the contact rate among the population, commonly
referred to as social distancing, in order to reduce the spread of the disease.
We pose a mean-field game model of individuals each choosing a dynamic strategy
of making contacts, given the trade-off of utility from contacts but also risk
of infection from those contacts. We compute and compare the mean-field
equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes individuals acting selfishly to
maximize their own utility, to the socially optimal strategy, which is the
strategy maximizing the total utility of the population. We prove that the
infected always want to make more contacts than the level at which it would be
socially optimal, which reinforces the need to reduce contacts of the infected
(e.g. quarantining, sick paid leave). Additionally, we compute the socially
optimal strategies, given the costs to incentivize people to change from their
selfish strategies. We find that if we impose limited resources, curbing
contacts of the infected is more important after the peak of the epidemic has
passed. Lastly, we compute the price of anarchy of this system, to understand
the conditions under which large discrepancies between the MFE and socially
optimal strategies arise, which is when public policy would be most effective.

    <title>A Conjectural Experiment to Observe the Effect of Conditional
  locked-down in an Epidemic</title>
    <summary>  In a pandemic like Covid-19, there are many countries of lower-earning cannot
provide a complete locked-down within the duration of the detected case. The
locked-down may result in famine throughout the region of underdeveloped
countries after the outbreak. So, a conjectural setup of an epidemic has been
studied by applying specific period of locked-down (30 days) in 5 different
scenarios. The stochastic approach to the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected
and Recovered) model has been used to evaluate the dynamics and the effects of
locked-down. It is observed that there exist a suitable period to apply
locked-down where more susceptible escape from the infection. The effect of the
early (as soon as the infected case detected) and late (with respect to the
estimated peak of detected cases for no locked-down) implementation of the
locked-down has also been studied and found that the late implementation of
locked-down will take the least time to end the epidemic. The CFR (Case
Fatality Rate) has also been found to be varied from 7.55 to 8.02 for all the
considered scenarios.

    <title>A chatbot architecture for promoting youth resilience</title>
    <summary>  E-health technologies have the potential to provide scalable and accessible
interventions for youth mental health. As part of a developing an ecosystem of
e-screening and e-therapy tools for New Zealand young people, a dialog agent,
Headstrong, has been designed to promote resilience with methods grounded in
cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. This paper describes the
architecture underlying the chatbot. The architecture supports a range of over
20 activities delivered in a 4-week program by relatable personas. The
architecture provides a visual authoring interface to its content management
system. In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot,
the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention
for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with
the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used
in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of
creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy
that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.

    <title>Keystroke Biometrics in Response to Fake News Propagation in a Global
  Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  This work proposes and analyzes the use of keystroke biometrics for content
de-anonymization. Fake news have become a powerful tool to manipulate public
opinion, especially during major events. In particular, the massive spread of
fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments and companies to
fight against missinformation. In this context, the ability to link multiple
accounts or profiles that spread such malicious content on the Internet while
hiding in anonymity would enable proactive identification and blacklisting.
Behavioral biometrics can be powerful tools in this fight. In this work, we
have analyzed how the latest advances in keystroke biometric recognition can
help to link behavioral typing patterns in experiments involving 100,000 users
and more than 1 million typed sequences. Our proposed system is based on
Recurrent Neural Networks adapted to the context of content de-anonymization.
Assuming the challenge to link the typed content of a target user in a pool of
candidate profiles, our results show that keystroke recognition can be used to
reduce the list of candidate profiles by more than 90%. In addition, when
keystroke is combined with auxiliary data (such as location), our system
achieves a Rank-1 identification performance equal to 52.6% and 10.9% for a
background candidate list composed of 1K and 100K profiles, respectively.

    <title>Tracking and tracing in the UK: a dynamic causal modelling study</title>
    <summary>  By equipping a previously reported dynamic causal model of COVID-19 with an
isolation state, we modelled the effects of self-isolation consequent on
tracking and tracing. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state
occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and
only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of
the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests
for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the
outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions
emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded)
relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is
unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on
the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists
no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring
or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing
policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any
second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is
within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and
tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000
tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for
which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative
analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent
serological studies.

    <title>Epidemiological dynamics with fine temporal resolution</title>
    <summary>  To better predict the dynamics of spread of COVID-19 epidemics, it is
important not only to investigate the network of local and long-range
contagious contacts, but also to understand the temporal dynamics of
infectiousness and detectable symptoms. Here we present a model of infection
spread in a well-mixed group of individuals, which usually corresponds to a
node in large-scale epidemiological networks. The model uses delay equations
that take into account the duration of infection and is based on
experimentally-derived time courses of viral load, virus shedding, severity and
detectability of symptoms. We show that because of an early onset of
infectiousness, which is reported to be synchronous or even precede the onset
of detectable symptoms, the tracing and immediate testing of everyone who came
in contact with the detected infected individual reduces the spread of
epidemics, hospital load, and fatality rate. We hope that this more precise
node dynamics could be incorporated into complex large-scale epidemiological
models to improve the accuracy and credibility of predictions.

    <title>Security Survey and Analysis of Vote-by-Mail Systems</title>
    <summary>  Voting by mail has been gaining traction for decades in the United States and
has emerged as the preferred voting method during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this paper, we examine the security of electronic systems used in the process
of voting by mail, including online voter registration and online ballot
tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration
and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably
provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the
security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We
find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities
that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy
questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities
discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several
could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence
in U.S. elections infrastructure, thereby undermining the very purpose of these
systems.

    <title>A Privacy-Preserving Solution for Proximity Tracing Avoiding Identifier
  Exchanging</title>
    <summary>  Digital contact tracing is one of the actions useful, in combination with
other measures, to manage an epidemic diffusion of an infection disease in an
after-lock-down phase. This is a very timely issue, due to the pandemic of
COVID-19 we are unfortunately living. Apps for contact tracing aim to detect
proximity of users and to evaluate the related risk in terms of possible
contagious. Existing approaches leverage Bluetooth or GPS, or their
combination, even though the prevailing approach is Bluetooth-based and relies
on a decentralized model requiring the mutual exchange of ephemeral identifiers
among users' smartphones. Unfortunately, a number of security and privacy
concerns exist in this kind of solutions, mainly due to the exchange of
identifiers, while GPS-based solutions (inherently centralized) may suffer from
threats concerning massive surveillance. In this paper, we propose a solution
leveraging GPS to detect proximity, and Bluetooth only to improve accuracy,
without enabling exchange of identifiers. Unlike related existing solutions, no
complex cryptographic mechanism is adopted, while ensuring that the server does
not learn anything about locations of users.

    <title>Production networks and epidemic spreading: How to restart the UK
  economy?</title>
    <summary>  We analyse the economics and epidemiology of different scenarios for a phased
restart of the UK economy. Our economic model is designed to address the unique
features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both
supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting
economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to
model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts
conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry
are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also
includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption.
We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of
production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects,
and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few
industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and
contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the
transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening
scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the
increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that
yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in
economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer
facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare,
and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.

    <title>PaccMann$^{RL}$ on SARS-CoV-2: Designing antiviral candidates with
  conditional generative models</title>
    <summary>  With the fast development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, scientists
around the globe are desperately searching for effective antiviral therapeutic
agents. Bridging systems biology and drug discovery, we propose a deep learning
framework for conditional de novo design of antiviral candidate drugs tailored
against given protein targets. First, we train a multimodal ligand--protein
binding affinity model on predicting affinities of antiviral compounds to
target proteins and couple this model with pharmacological toxicity predictors.
Exploiting this multi-objective as a reward function of a conditional molecular
generator (consisting of two VAEs), we showcase a framework that navigates the
chemical space toward regions with more antiviral molecules. Specifically, we
explore a challenging setting of generating ligands against unseen protein
targets by performing a leave-one-out-cross-validation on 41 SARS-CoV-2-related
target proteins. Using deep RL, it is demonstrated that in 35 out of 41 cases,
the generation is biased towards sampling more binding ligands, with an average
increase of 83% comparing to an unbiased VAE. We present a case-study on a
potential Envelope-protein inhibitor and perform a synthetic accessibility
assessment of the best generated molecules is performed that resembles a viable
roadmap towards a rapid in-vitro evaluation of potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.

    <title>Emotion-robust EEG Classification for Motor Imagery</title>
    <summary>  Developments in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are empowering those with
severe physical afflictions through their use in assistive systems. Common
methods of achieving this is via Motor Imagery (MI), which maps brain signals
to code for certain commands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is preferred for
recording brain signal data on account of it being non-invasive. Despite their
potential utility, MI-BCI systems are yet confined to research labs. A major
cause for this is lack of robustness of such systems. As hypothesized by two
teams during Cybathlon 2016, a particular source of the system's vulnerability
is the sharp change in the subject's state of emotional arousal. This work aims
towards making MI-BCI systems resilient to such emotional perturbations. To do
so, subjects are exposed to high and low arousal-inducing virtual reality (VR)
environments before recording EEG data. The advent of COVID-19 compelled us to
modify our methodology. Instead of training machine learning algorithms to
classify emotional arousal, we opt for classifying subjects that serve as proxy
for each state. Additionally, MI models are trained for each subject instead of
each arousal state. As training subjects to use MI-BCI can be an arduous and
time-consuming process, reducing this variability and increasing robustness can
considerably accelerate the acceptance and adoption of assistive technologies
powered by BCI.

    <title>Stochasticity and heterogeneity in the transmission dynamics of
  SARS-CoV-2</title>
    <summary>  SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease has moved rapidly around the globe,
infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction
number, which has been widely used and misused to characterize the
transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic,
is dominated by a small number of individuals, and is driven by super-spreading
events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features, such as high stochasticity
under low prevalence, and the central role played by SSEs on transmission
dynamics, should not be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor
settings stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care
facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, fish factories, cruise ships, family
gatherings, parties and night clubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to
understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity that outbreak
can be effectively contained with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs.
Here, we describe the potential types of SSEs, how they influence transmission,
and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.

    <title>Quantifying the effects of quarantine using an IBM SEIR model on
  scalefree networks</title>
    <summary>  The COVID-19 pandemic led several countries to resort to social distancing,
the only known way to slow down the spread of the virus and keep the health
system under control. Here we use an individual based model (IBM) to study how
the duration, start date and intensity of quarantine affect the height and
position of the peak of the infection curve. We show that stochastic effects,
inherent to the model dynamics, lead to variable outcomes for the same set of
parameters, making it crucial to compute the probability of each result. To
simplify the analysis we divide the outcomes in only two categories, that we
call {best and worst scenarios. Although long and intense quarantine is the
best way to end the epidemic, it is very hard to implement in practice. Here we
show that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very
effective in flattening the infection curve and even killing the virus, but the
likelihood of such outcomes are low. Long quarantines of relatively low
intensity, on the other hand, can delay the infection peak and reduce its size
considerably with more than 50% probability, being a more effective policy than
complete lockdown for short periods.

    <title>Modelling oral adrenal cortisol support</title>
    <summary>  A simplified mathematical model of oral hydrocortisone delivery in adrenal
insufficiency is described; the model is based on three components (gastric
hydrocortisone, free serum cortisol and bound serum cortisol) and is formulated
in terms of linear kinetics, taking into account the dynamics of
glucocorticoid-protein binding. Motivated by the need to optimise cortisol
replacement in the situations of COVID-19 infection, the model is fitted to
recently-published data on 50 mg dosing and earlier data on 10 mg dosing. The
fitted model is used to predict typical responses to standard dosing regimes,
which involve a larger dose in the morning and 1 or 2 smaller doses later in
the day, and the same regimes with doses doubled. In all cases there is a
circadian-like response, with early morning nadir. The model is also used to
consider an alternative dosing strategy based on four equal and equally-spaced
doses of 10, 20 or 30 mg per 24 h, resulting in a more even response resembling
a response to sustained inflammatory stress.

    <title>In silico identification of potential natural product inhibitors of
  human proteases key to SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
    <summary>  Presently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19 which
has spread to over 200 countries and is responsible for over 3,65,000 deaths
worldwide. Recent studies have shown that two human proteases, TMPRSS2 and
cathepsin L, play a key role in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly,
inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here,
we perform virtual screening of 14010 phytochemicals produced by Indian
medicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and
cathepsin L. We built a homology model of TMPRSS2 as an experimentally
determined structure is not available. AutoDock Vina was used to perform
molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 model structure and
cathepsin L crystal structure. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filtered
by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of
TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and
non-covalent protein-ligand interactions were used as an additional filter to
identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with
residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. We have
identified 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among
phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. The top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 are
Edgeworoside C, Adlumidine and Qingdainone, and of cathepsin L is Ararobinol.
Interestingly, several herbal sources of identified phytochemical inhibitors
have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine. Further in
vitro and in vivo testing is needed before clinical trials of the promising
phytochemical inhibitors identified here.

    <title>Data-driven Identification of Number of Unreported Cases for COVID-19:
  Bounds and Limitations</title>
    <summary>  Accurate forecasts for COVID-19 are necessary for better preparedness and
resource management. Specifically, deciding the response over months or several
months requires accurate long-term forecasts which is particularly challenging
as the model errors accumulate with time. A critical factor that can hinder
accurate long-term forecasts, is the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases.
While there have been early serology tests to estimate this number, more tests
need to be conducted for more reliable results. To identify the number of
unreported/asymptomatic cases, we take an epidemiology data-driven approach. We
show that we can identify lower bounds on this ratio or upper bound on actual
cases as a factor of reported cases. To do so, we propose an extension of our
prior heterogeneous infection rate model, incorporating unreported/asymptomatic
cases. We prove that the number of unreported cases can be reliably estimated
only from a certain time period of the epidemic data. In doing so, we construct
an algorithm called Fixed Infection Rate method, which identifies a reliable
bound on the learned ratio. We also propose two heuristics to learn this ratio
and show their effectiveness on simulated data. We use our approaches to
identify the upper bounds on the ratio of actual to reported cases for New York
City and several US states. Our results demonstrate with high confidence that
the actual number of cases cannot be more than 35 times in New York, 40 times
in Illinois, 38 times in Massachusetts and 29 times in New Jersey, than the
reported cases.

    <title>Information Consumption and Social Response in a Segregated Environment:
  the Case of Gab</title>
    <summary>  Most of the information operations involve users who may foster polarization
and distrust toward science and mainstream journalism, without these users
being conscious of their role. Gab is well known to be an extremist-friendly
platform that performs little control on the posted content. Thus it represents
an ideal benchmark for studying phenomena potentially related to polarization
such as misinformation spreading. The combination of these factors may lead to
hate as well as to episodes of harm in the real world. In this work we provide
a characterization of the interaction patterns within Gab around the COVID-19
topic. To assess the spreading of different content type, we analyze
consumption patterns based on both interaction type and source reliability.
Overall we find that there are no strong statistical differences in the social
response to questionable and reliable content, both following a power law
distribution. However, questionable and reliable sources display structural and
topical differences in the use of hashtags. The commenting behaviour of users
in terms of both lifetime and sentiment reveals that questionable and reliable
posts are perceived in the same manner. We can conclude that despite evident
differences between questionable and reliable posts Gab users do not perform
such a differentiation thus treating them as a whole. Our results provide
insights toward the understanding of coordinated inauthentic behavior and on
the early-warning of information operation.

    <title>An apparatus for nondestructive and rapid comparison of mask approaches
  in defense against infected respiratory aerosols</title>
    <summary>  At the front lines of the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic are
hero-clinicians facing a lack of critical supplies including protective medical
grade breathing masks and filtering materials. At the same time, the general
public is now being advised to wear masks to help stop the spread. As a result,
in the absence of centrally coordinated production and distribution efforts,
supply chains for masks, respirators, and materials for advanced filtration
technology are immensely burdened. Here we describe experimental efforts to
nondestructively quantify three vital characteristics of mask approaches:
breathability, material filtration effectiveness, and sensitivity to fit. We
focus on protection against water aerosols $&gt;$0.3$\mu$m using off-the-shelf
particulate, flow, and pressure sensors, permitting rapid comparative
evaluation of these three properties. We present and discuss both the pressure
drop and the particle transmission as a function of flow to permit comparison
of relative protection for a set of proposed filter and mask designs. The
design considerations of the testing apparatus can be reproduced by university
laboratories and medical facilities and used for rapid local quality control of
respirator masks which are of uncertified origin, monitoring the long-term
effects of various disinfection schemes, and evaluating improvised products not
designed or marketed for filtration.

    <title>Confidence in the dynamic spread of epidemics under biased sampling
  conditions</title>
    <summary>  The interpretation of sampling data plays a crucial role in policy response
to the spread of a disease during an epidemic, such as the COVID-19 epidemic of
2020. However, this is a non-trivial endeavor due to the complexity of real
world conditions and limits to the availability of diagnostic tests, which
necessitate a bias in testing favoring symptomatic individuals. A thorough
understanding of sampling confidence and bias is necessary in order make
accurate conclusions. In this manuscript, we provide a stochastic model of
sampling for assessing confidence in disease metrics such as trend detection,
peak detection, and disease spread estimation. Our model simulates testing for
a disease in an epidemic with known dynamics, allowing us to use Monte-Carlo
sampling to assess metric confidence. We use this method to show that trends in
the disease may be identified using under $10000$ biased samples each day, and
an estimate of disease spread can be made with additional $1000-2000$ unbiased
samples each day. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to assess more
advanced metrics by finding the precision and recall of a strategy for finding
peaks in the dynamics.

    <title>Bayesian workflow for disease transmission modeling in Stan</title>
    <summary>  This tutorial shows how to build, fit, and criticize disease transmission
models in Stan, and should be useful to researchers interested in modeling the
COVID-19 outbreak and doing Bayesian inference. Bayesian modeling provides a
principled way to quantify uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge into the
model. What is more, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
sampling, is amiable to diagnostics, which means we can verify whether our
inference is reliable. Stan is an expressive probabilistic programing language
that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. The
resulting code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's
work more transparent and flexible. In this tutorial, we demonstrate with a
simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model how to formulate, fit, and
diagnose a compartmental model in Stan. We also introduce more advanced topics
which can help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably, how to use
simulations to probe our model and our priors, and computational techniques to
scale ODE-based models.

    <title>Identifiability and estimation under the test-negative design with
  population controls with the goal of identifying risk and preventive factors
  for SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
    <summary>  Due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
quick public health investigations of the relationships between behaviours and
infection risk are essential. Recently the test-negative design was proposed to
recruit and survey participants who are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection
in order to evaluate associations between their characteristics and testing
positive on the test. It was also proposed to recruit additional untested
controls who are part of the general public in order to have a baseline
comparison group. This study design involves two major challenges for
statistical risk factor analysis: 1) the selection bias invoked by selecting on
people being tested and 2) imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the
SARS-CoV-2 test. In this study, we investigate the nonparametric
identifiability of potential statistical parameters of interest under a
hypothetical data structure, expressed through missing data directed acyclic
graphs. We clarify the types of data that must be collected in order to
correctly estimate the parameter of interest. We then propose a novel inverse
probability weighting estimator that can consistently estimate the parameter of
interest under correctly specified nuisance models.

    <title>Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge Encoder-Decoder for Medical Report
  Generation</title>
    <summary>  Beyond the common difficulties faced in the natural image captioning, medical
report generation specifically requires the model to describe a medical image
with a fine-grained and semantic-coherence paragraph that should satisfy both
medical commonsense and logic. Previous works generally extract the global
image features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to
referenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the
regions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area
of the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be
considered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are
many similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal
regions of the image, which causes serious data bias. This deviation is likely
to teach models to generate these inessential sentences on a regular basis. To
address these problems, we propose an Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge
Encoder-Decoder (ASGK) to mimic radiologists' working patterns. In more detail,
ASGK integrates internal visual feature fusion and external medical linguistic
information to guide medical knowledge transfer and learning. The core
structure of ASGK consists of a medical graph encoder and a natural language
decoder, inspired by advanced Generative Pre-Training (GPT). Experiments on the
CX-CHR dataset and our COVID-19 CT Report dataset demonstrate that our proposed
ASGK is able to generate a robust and accurate report, and moreover outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both medical terminology classification and
paragraph generation metrics.

    <title>The Zoltar forecast archive: a tool to facilitate standardization and
  storage of interdisciplinary prediction research</title>
    <summary>  Forecasting has emerged as an important component of informed, data-driven
decision-making in a wide array of fields. We introduce a new data model for
probabilistic predictions that encompasses a wide range of forecasting
settings. This framework clearly defines the constituent parts of a
probabilistic forecast and proposes one approach for representing these data
elements. The data model is implemented in Zoltar, a new software application
that stores forecasts using the data model and provides standardized API access
to the data. In one real-time case study, an instance of the Zoltar web
application was used to store, provide access to, and evaluate real-time
forecast data on the order of 10$^7$ rows, provided by over 20 international
research teams from academia and industry making forecasts of the COVID-19
outbreak in the US. Tools and data infrastructure for probabilistic forecasts,
such as those introduced here, will play an increasingly important role in
ensuring that future forecasting research adheres to a strict set of rigorous
and reproducible standards.

    <title>Masks and COVID-19: a causal framework for imputing value to
  public-health interventions</title>
    <summary>  Considerable analytical work during the COVID-19 pandemic has been devoted to
developing predictive models to evaluate the merits of potential governmental
interventions versus the cost of not carrying them out. These prospective
modeling efforts are based on formal assumptions, like the choice of
epidemiological mode, and on the extrapolation of past timecourse data to the
future. As both these aspects carry substantial potential for error, trusted
models used by decision-makers of public policy undergo nearly continuous
revision cycles. Less methodologically developed is to assess retrospectively
the effects these interventions had. Here we present a proposal for a
model-free data-driven framework. We use a sparse regression method to fit the
dynamic progression of the data (the Rt parameter) with the least number of
changes, allowing us to attribute discrete change events to specific
intervention events. Since the sparse fit yields a discrete jump between two
constant Rt, we follow do-operator prescriptions and simulate the
counterfactual case by forcing Rt to stay at the pre-jump value. We then
attribute a nominal value to the intervention from the difference between true
evolution and simulated counterfactual, for example, in terms of reducing the
number of cases or accelerating the timecourse towards a milestone. As an
example, we show that the recommendation to use facemasks for all activities
would result in a putative total of 71000 (95% CI 64000 to 78000) fewer
official cases in New York State.

    <title>A Toolkit for Analyzing and Visualizing Online Users via Reshare Cascade
  Modeling</title>
    <summary>  Modeling online discourse dynamics is a core activity in understanding the
spread of information, both offline and online, and emergent online behavior.
There is currently a disconnect between the practitioners of online social
media analysis - usually social, political and communication scientists - and
the accessibility to tools capable of handling large quantities of online data,
and examining online users and their behavior. We present two tools,birdspotter
and evently, for analyzing online users based on their involvement in retweet
cascades. birdspotter provides a toolkit to measure social influence and
botnets of Twitter users. While it leverages the multimodal information of
tweets, such as text contents, evently augments the user measurement by
modeling the temporal dynamics of information diffusions using self-exciting
processes. Both tools are designed for users with a wide range of computer
expertise and include tutorials and detailed documentation. We illustrate a
case study of a topical dataset relating to COVID-19, using both tools for
end-to-end analysis of online user behavior.

    <title>Targeting Receptor Binding Domain and Cryptic Pocket of Spike
  glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 by biomolecular modeling</title>
    <summary>  SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease known as Covid-19, has so far
reported around 3,435,000 cases of human infections, including more than
239,000 deaths in 187 countries, with no effective treatment currently
available. For this reason, it is necessary to explore new approaches for the
development of a drug capable of inhibiting the entry of the virus into the
host cell. Therefore, this work includes the exploration of potential
inhibitory compounds for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6VSB), which
were obtained from The Patogen Box. Later, they were filtered through virtual
screening and molecular docking techniques, thus obtaining a top of 1000
compounds, which were used against a binding site located in the Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD) and a cryptic site located in the N-Terminal Domain (NTD),
resulting in good pharmaceutical targets for the blocking the infection. From
the top 1000, the best compound (TCMDC-124223) was selected for the binding
site. It interacts with specific residues that intervene in the recognition and
subsequent entry into the host cell, resulting in a more favorable binding free
energy in comparison to the control compounds (Hesperidine and Emodine). In the
same way, the compound TCMDC-133766 was selected for the cryptic site. These
identified compounds are potential inhibitors that can be used for the
development of new drugs that allow effective treatment for the disease.

    <title>PrivyTRAC: Privacy and Security Preserving Contact Tracing System</title>
    <summary>  Smartphone location-based methods have been proposed and implemented as an
effective alternative to traditional labor intensive contact tracing methods.
However, there are serious privacy and security concerns that may impede
wide-spread adoption in many societies. Furthermore, these methods rely solely
on proximity to patients, based on Bluetooth or GPS signal for example,
ignoring lingering effects of virus, including COVID-19, present in the
environment. This results in inaccurate risk assessment and incomplete contact
tracing. A new system concept, called PrivyTRAC, preserves user privacy,
increases security and improves accuracy of smartphone contact tracing.
PrivyTRAC enhances users' and patients' privacy by letting users conduct
self-evaluation based on the risk maps download to their smartphones. No user
information is transmitted to external locations or devices, and no personally
identifiable patient information is embedded in the risk maps as they are
processed anonymized and aggregated locations of confirmed patients. The risk
maps consider both spatial proximity and temporal effects to improve the
accuracy of the infection risk estimation. Experiments conducted in the paper
illustrate improvement of PrivyTRAC over proximity based methods in terms of
true and false positives. An approach to further improve infection risk
estimation by incorporating both positive and negative local test results from
contacts of confirmed cases is also described.

    <title>Exact and computationally efficient Bayesian inference for generalized
  Markov modulated Poisson processes</title>
    <summary>  Statistical modeling of point patterns is an important and common problem in
several areas. The Poisson process is the most common process used for this
purpose, in particular, its generalization that considers the intensity
function to be stochastic. This is called a Cox process and different choices
to model the dynamics of the intensity gives raise to a wide range of models.
We present a new class of unidimensional Cox processes models in which the
intensity function assumes parametric functional forms that switch among them
according to a continuous-time Markov chain. A novel methodology is proposed to
perform exact Bayesian inference based on MCMC algorithms. The term exact
refers to the fact that no discrete time approximation is used and Monte Carlo
error is the only source of inaccuracy. The reliability of the algorithms
depends on a variety of specifications which are carefully addressed, resulting
in a computationally efficient (in terms of computing time) algorithm and
enabling its use with large datasets. Simulated and real examples are presented
to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology. An
specific model to fit epidemic curves is proposed and used to analyzed data
from Dengue Fever in Brazil and COVID-19 in some countries.

    <title>Are you wearing a mask? Improving mask detection from speech using
  augmentation by cycle-consistent GANs</title>
    <summary>  The task of detecting whether a person wears a face mask from speech is
useful in modelling speech in forensic investigations, communication between
surgeons or people protecting themselves against infectious diseases such as
COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach for mask
detection from speech. Our approach is based on (i) training Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) with cycle-consistency loss to translate unpaired
utterances between two classes (with mask and without mask), and on (ii)
generating new training utterances using the cycle-consistent GANs, assigning
opposite labels to each translated utterance. Original and translated
utterances are converted into spectrograms which are provided as input to a set
of ResNet neural networks with various depths. The networks are combined into
an ensemble through a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. With this
system, we participated in the Mask Sub-Challenge (MSC) of the INTERSPEECH 2020
Computational Paralinguistics Challenge, surpassing the baseline proposed by
the organizers by 2.8%. Our data augmentation technique provided a performance
boost of 0.9% on the private test set. Furthermore, we show that our data
augmentation approach yields better results than other baseline and
state-of-the-art augmentation methods.

    <title>SwissCovid: a critical analysis of risk assessment by Swiss authorities</title>
    <summary>  Ahead of the rollout of the SwissCovid contact tracing app, an official
public security test was performed. During this audit, Prof. Serge Vaudenay and
Dr. Martin Vuagnoux described a large set of problems with the app, including a
new variation of a known false-positive attack, leveraging a cryptographic
weakness in the Google and Apple Exposure Notification framework to tamper with
the emitted Bluetooth beacons. Separately, the first author described a
re-identification attack leveraging rogue apps or SDKs. The response from the
Swiss cybersecurity agency and the Swiss public health authority was to claim
these various attacks were unlikely as they required physical proximity of the
attacker with the target (although it was admitted the attacker could be
further than two meters). The physical presence of the attacker in Switzerland
was deemed significant as it would imply such attackers would fall under the
Swiss Criminal Code. We show through one example that a much larger variety of
adversaries must be considered in the scenarios originally described and that
these attacks can be done by adversaries without any physical presence in
Switzerland. This goes directly against official findings of Swiss public
authorities evaluating the risks associated with SwissCovid. To move the
discussion further along, we briefly discuss the growth of the attack surface
and harms with COVID-19 and SwissCovid prevalence in the population. While the
focus of this article is on Switzerland, we emphasize the core technical
findings and cybersecurity concerns are of relevance to many contact tracing
efforts.

    <title>COVID-ResNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Screening of COVID19 from
  Radiographs</title>
    <summary>  In the last few months, the novel COVID19 pandemic has spread all over the
world. Due to its easy transmission, developing techniques to accurately and
easily identify the presence of COVID19 and distinguish it from other forms of
flu and pneumonia is crucial. Recent research has shown that the chest Xrays of
patients suffering from COVID19 depicts certain abnormalities in the
radiography. However, those approaches are closed source and not made available
to the research community for re-producibility and gaining deeper insight. The
goal of this work is to build open source and open access datasets and present
an accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework for differentiating COVID19
cases from other pneumonia cases. Our work utilizes state of the art training
techniques including progressive resizing, cyclical learning rate finding and
discriminative learning rates to training fast and accurate residual neural
networks. Using these techniques, we showed the state of the art results on the
open-access COVID-19 dataset. This work presents a 3-step technique to
fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture to improve model performance and
reduce training time. We call it COVIDResNet. This is achieved through
progressively re-sizing of input images to 128x128x3, 224x224x3, and 229x229x3
pixels and fine-tuning the network at each stage. This approach along with the
automatic learning rate selection enabled us to achieve the state of the art
accuracy of 96.23% (on all the classes) on the COVIDx dataset with only 41
epochs. This work presented a computationally efficient and highly accurate
model for multi-class classification of three different infection types from
along with Normal individuals. This model can help in the early screening of
COVID19 cases and help reduce the burden on healthcare systems.

    <title>Efficient network immunization under limited knowledge</title>
    <summary>  Targeted immunization or attacks of large-scale networks has attracted
significant attention by the scientific community. However, in real-world
scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby
precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in
order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic.
Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed
at a time and the most central between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or
attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until $1-p$ fraction of nodes
are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this
approach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of
the giant component $P_{\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree
distributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\to\infty$ we recover prior work on
targeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure.
Between these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases
quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with
complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between
$|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|$ and $n$ as $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|\sim n^{-1}\exp(-\alpha
n)$. For Scale-free (SF) networks, where $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}, 2&lt;\gamma&lt;3$, we
find that $p_c$ has a transition from zero to non-zero when $n$ increases from
$n=1$ to order of $\log N$ ($N$ is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks,
knowledge of order of $\log N$ nodes and immunizing them can reduce
dramatically an epidemics.

    <title>COVID-19: Analytics Of Contagion On Inhomogeneous Random Social Networks</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the need for novel robust approaches to modelling the Covid-19
epidemic, this paper treats a population of $N$ individuals as an inhomogeneous
random social network (IRSN). The nodes of the network represent different
types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships.
An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on
day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social
behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability
distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is
given for the basic SI ("susceptible-infective") network contagion model, which
focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main
result is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of
the system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves
only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network
models, including "removed" (R) and "exposed" (E) classes, are formulated.
These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for
the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of
different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social
distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an
algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a
number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as
the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent
based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic
modelling.

    <title>InfecTracer: Approximate Nearest Neighbors Retrieval of GPS Location
  Traces to Retrieve Susceptible Cases</title>
    <summary>  Epidemics, such as the present Covid-19 pandemic, usually spread at a rapid
rate. Standard models, e.g., the SIR model, have stressed on the importance of
finding the susceptible cases to flatten the growth rate of the spread of
infection as early as possible. In the present scientific world, location
traces in the form of GPS coordinates are logged by mobile device manufacturing
and their operating systems developing companies, such as Apple, Samsung,
Google etc. However, due to the sensitive nature of this data, it is usually
not shared with other organisations, mainly to protect individual privacy.
However, in disaster situations, such as epidemics, data in the form of
location traces of a community of people can potentially be helpful to
proactively locate susceptible people from the community and enforce quarantine
on them as early as possible.
  Since procuring such data for the purpose of restricted use is difficult
(time-consuming) due to the sensitive nature of the data, a strong case needs
to be made that how could such data be useful in disaster situations. The aim
of this article is to to demonstrate a proof-of-the-concept that with the
availability of massive amounts of real check-in data, it is feasible to
develop a scalable system that is both effective (in terms of identifying the
susceptible people) and efficient (in terms of the time taken to do so). We
believe that this proof-of-the-concept will encourage sharing (with restricted
use) of such sensitive data in order to help mitigate disaster situations.
  In this article, we describe a software resource to efficiently (consuming a
small run-time) locate a set of susceptible persons given a global database of
user check-ins and a set of infected people. Specifically, we describe a
system, named InfecTracer, that seeks to find out cases of close proximity of a
person with another infected person.

    <title>Optimal group testing under real world restrictions</title>
    <summary>  In the group testing problem one aims to infer a small set of $k$ infected
individuals out of a large population of size $n$. At our disposal we have a
testing scheme which allows us to test a group of individuals, such that the
outcome of the test is positive, if and only if at least one infected
individual is part of the test. All tests are carried out in parallel. The
overall goal is to find a test design and an inference algorithm requiring as
few tests as possible, such that the infected individuals can be identified
with high probability. As most relevant during the outbreak of pandemic
diseases (Wang et al., 2011), our analysis focusses on the so-called sublinear
regime of group testing, where $k \sim n^\theta$. The optimal group testing
schemes require a test-size of $\sim n/k$ and each individual has to take part
in $\sim \log n$ tests (Coja-Oghlan et. al, 2019). In real world applications,
like testing many individuals in a short period of time during the outbreak of
epidemics, pooling in such a way is not possible due to dilution effects.
Evidence of those effects is known for important applications like HIV (Wein,
1996) or COVID-19 (Seifried and Ciesek, 2020). Our main contribution is the
analysis of a group testing model, where we restrict the individuals-per-test
to be finite. We present an easy to implement scheme to pool individuals into
tests under these natural restrictions coming with the efficient decoding
algorithm DD and present simulations which suggest that the decoding procedure
succeeds for moderate population sizes. Furthermore, we show that our pooling
scheme requires the fewest tests as possible under all pooling schemes.
Finally, we apply our methods to the finitely many tests-per-individuals
setting, where we provide a full understanding of the random regular
test-design in this model by building up on work of (Gandikota et al., 2016).

    <title>Dynamical Theory and Cellular Automata Simulations of Pandemic Spread:
  Understanding Different Temporal Patterns of Infections</title>
    <summary>  Here we propose and implement a generalized mathematical model to find the
time evolution of population in infectious diseases and apply the model to
study the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our model at the core is a non-local
generalization of the widely used Kermack-McKendrick(KM) model where the
susceptible(S) population evolves into two other categories, namely
infectives(I) and removed(R). This is the well-known SIR model in which we
further divide both S and I into high and low risk categories. We first
formulate a set of non-local dynamical equations for the time evolution of
distinct population distributions under this categorization in an attempt to
describe the general scenario of infectious disease progression. We then solve
the non-linear coupled differential equations-(i) numerically by the method of
propagation, and (ii) a more flexible and versatile cellular automata (CA)
simulation which provides a coarse-grained description of the generalized
non-local model. In order to account for multiple factors such as role of
spreaders before containment, we introduce a time dependent rate which appears
to be essential to explain the sudden spikes before the plateau observed in
many cases (for example like China). We demonstrate how this generalized
approach allows us to handle the effects of (i) time-dependence of the
rate-constants of spread, (ii) different population density, (iii) the age
ratio, (iv) quarantine, (v) lockdown, and (vi) social distancing. Our study
allows us to make certain predictions regarding the nature of spread with
respect to several external parameters, treated as control variables. Analysis
of the model clearly shows that due to the strong heterogeneity in the epidemic
process originating from the distribution of initial infectives, the theory
must be local in character but at the same time connect to a global
perspective.

    <title>Two Burning Questions on COVID-19: Did shutting down the economy help?
  Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?</title>
    <summary>  As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question
facing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second
wave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if
it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic
while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand
the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their
corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,
the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential
trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that
works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of
Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a
data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario
planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between
different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the
method leverages information from different interventions that have already
been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of
interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on
the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility
restrictions to create a "synthetic low mobility U.S." and predict the
counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar
intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe
mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at
retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope
this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the
population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.

    <title>Decentralised, privacy-preserving Bayesian inference for mobile phone
  contact tracing</title>
    <summary>  Many countries are currently gearing up to use smart-phone apps to perform
contact tracing as part of the effort to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and
prevent resurgences of the disease after the initial outbreak. With the
announcement of the Apple/Google partnership to introduce contact-tracing
functionality to iOS and Android, it seems likely that this will be adopted in
many countries. An important part of the functionality of the app will be to
decide whether a person should be advised to self-isolate, be tested or end
isolation. However, the privacy preserving nature of the Apple/Google contact
tracing algorithm means that centralised curation of these decisions is not
possible so each phone must use its own "risk model" to inform decisions.
Ideally, the risk model should use Bayesian inference to decide the best course
of action given the test results of the user and those of other users. Here we
present a decentralised algorithm that estimates the Bayesian posterior
probability of viral transmission events and evaluates when a user should be
notified, tested or released from isolation while preserving user privacy. The
algorithm also allows the disease models on the phones to learn from everyone's
contact-tracing data and will allow Epidemiologists to better understand the
dynamics of the disease. The algorithm is a message passing algorithm, based on
belief propagation, so each smart-phone can be used to execute a small part of
the algorithm without releasing any sensitive information. In this way, the
network of all participating smart-phones forms a distributed computation
device that performs Bayesian inference, informs each user when they should
start/end isolation or be tested and learns about the disease from user's data.

    <title>Not all interventions are equal for the height of the second peak</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we conduct a simulation study of the spread of an epidemic like
COVID-19 with temporary immunity on finite spatial and non-spatial network
models. In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a
scale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a
temporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary
immunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again.
When the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model
three different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the
epidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on
maximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a
finite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of
the pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of "herd immunity".
For each model, there is a critical average immunity length $L_c$ above which
this happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to
flatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as
decrease the critical immunity length $L_c$, but elongate the epidemic.
However, when the average immunity length $L$ is shorter than $L_c$, the price
for the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the
maximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first
peak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention. Thirdly,
interventions introduce oscillations into the system and the time to reach
equilibrium is, for almost all scenarios, much longer. We conclude that
network-based epidemic models can show a variety of behaviors that are not
captured by the continuous compartmental models.

    <title>Inference, prediction and optimization of non-pharmaceutical
  interventions using compartment models: the PyRoss library</title>
    <summary>  PyRoss is an open-source Python library that offers an integrated platform
for inference, prediction and optimisation of NPIs in age- and
contact-structured epidemiological compartment models. This report outlines the
rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations
and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss
library supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as
master equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run
transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental
subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and
allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and
forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as
available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be
weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact
of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological
data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to
optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are
included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed
populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments
structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes
relevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such
compartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be
combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables,
could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to
detailed epidemic modelling. We invite others to use the PyRoss library for
research to address today's COVID-19 crisis, and to plan for future pandemics.

    <title>A Note on Cryptographic Algorithms for Private Data Analysis in Contact
  Tracing Applications</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing is an important measure to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. In
the early phase, many countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the
rate of disease spread, however it has many issues. The manual approach is
cumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation of a large
number of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital
contact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact
tracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements
and close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact
tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed
that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better
controlled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the
collected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption
rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy.
In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in
multiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for
mass surveillance by the concerned governments. Hence, privacy respecting
contact tracing application is the need of the hour that can lead to highly
effective, efficient contact tracing. As part of this study, we focus on
various cryptographic techniques that can help in addressing the Private Set
Intersection problem which lies at the heart of privacy respecting contact
tracing. We analyze the computation and communication complexities of these
techniques under the typical client-server architecture utilized by contact
tracing applications. Further we evaluate those computation and communication
complexity expressions for India scenario and thus identify cryptographic
techniques that can be more suitably deployed there.

    <title>Markets for Efficient Public Good Allocation</title>
    <summary>  Public goods are often either over-consumed in the absence of regulatory
mechanisms, or remain completely unused, as in the case of the Covid-19
pandemic, where social distance constraints are enforced to limit the number of
people who can share public spaces. In this work, we plug this gap through
market based mechanisms designed to efficiently allocate capacity constrained
public goods. To design these mechanisms, we leverage the theory of Fisher
markets, wherein each agent in the economy is endowed with an artificial
currency budget that they can spend to avail public goods. While Fisher markets
provide a strong methodological backbone to model resource allocation problems,
their applicability is limited to settings involving two types of constraints -
budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods. The presence of
additional physical constraints that arise in public goods allocation problems
motivates the need for modifications to the Fisher market framework to account
for these more general set of constraints. In our market mechanism, we
specifically modify the Fisher market social optimization problem through a
perturbation of the budgets of agents. The budget perturbations are set based
on the dual variables of the additional physical constraints such that the KKT
conditions of the newly defined social and individual optimization problems are
equivalent. This establishes that our mechanism sets market clearing prices
such that each agent obtains their maximum possible utilities subject to their
constraints. Finally, to compute the perturbation constants we present a fixed
point scheme, establish the existence of a unique fixed point and present
numerical experiments to illustrate convergence guarantees. Thus, our
mechanism, both theoretically and computationally, overcomes a fundamental
limitation of Fisher markets, which only consider capacity and budget
constraints.

    <title>The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic
  risk and spread</title>
    <summary>  Most models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for
COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the
infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact
occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely
to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here,
we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that
many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic
size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees
("risk" and "spread"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation
between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate
why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard
Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models
where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that
some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of
individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend
not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we
point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both
for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent
superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and
backward version of the classic "friendship paradox" -- forward links tend to
lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals
with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward
contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future
cascades of infection.

    <title>Covid-19: analysis of a modified SEIR model, a comparison of different
  intervention strategies and projections for India</title>
    <summary>  Modeling accurately the evolution and intervention strategies for the
Covid-19 pandemic is a challenging problem. We present here an analysis of an
extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model that accounts for
asymptomatic carriers, and explore the effect of different intervention
strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The
two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive
number $R_0$ to a target value $R_0^{\rm target} &lt; 1$, but in distinct ways,
which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same target
$R_0^{\rm target} &lt;1$, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than
lockdowns that only implement SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be
based on contact tracing and the ratio of tests/day to the number of new
cases/day has to be scaled with the mean number of contacts of an infectious
person, which would be high in densely populated regions with low levels of SD.
We point out that, apart from $R_0$, an important quantity is the largest
eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics which provides a more complete
understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and
explains observed data for many countries. Weak intervention strategies (that
reduce $R_0$ but not to a value less than $1$) can reduce the peak values of
infections and the asymptotic affected population. We provide simple analytic
expressions for these in terms of the disease parameters and apply them in the
Indian context to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic.
We find that the predictions strongly depend on the assumed fraction of
asymptomatic carriers.

    <title>Sustainable and resilient strategies for touristic cities against
  COVID-19: an agent-based approach</title>
    <summary>  Touristic cities will suffer from COVID-19 emergency because of its economic
impact on their communities. The first emergency phases involved a wide closure
of such areas to support "social distancing" measures (i.e. travels limitation;
lockdown of (over)crowd-prone activities). In the second phase, individual's
risk-mitigation strategies (facial masks) could be properly linked to "social
distancing" to ensure re-opening touristic cities to visitors. Simulation tools
could support the effectiveness evaluation of risk-mitigation measures to look
for an economic and social optimum for activities restarting. This work
modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in
touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and
virus effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated
proximity-based and exposure-time-based contagion spreading rules are included
according to international health organizations and previous calibration
through experimental data. Effects of tourists' capacity (as "social
distancing"-based measure) and other strategies (i.e. facial mask
implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related conditions (i.e.
initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant
case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare
the effectiveness of those solutions. Results show that "social distancing"
seems to be more effective at the highest infectors' rates, although represents
an extreme measure with important economic effects. This measure loses its full
effectiveness (on the community) as the infectors' rate decreases and
individuals' protection measures become predominant (facial masks). The model
could be integrated to consider other recurring issues on tourist-related
fruition and schedule of urban spaces and facilities (e.g. cultural/leisure
buildings).

    <title>On the Detection of Disinformation Campaign Activity with Network
  Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Online manipulation of information has become prevalent in recent years as
disinformation campaigns seek to polarize political topics. While we are aware
that disinformation campaigns exist, detecting their online presence is still
difficult. Researchers have proposed detecting disinformation campaigns on
Twitter by looking for specific coordination patterns (e.g., sharing the same
hashtag in a short time frame). The problem with this approach, however, is
that while the proposed coordination patterns may have been unique to the
studied disinformation campaigns, the patterns have not been thoroughly
validated against non-random samples or across a diverse set of campaigns. We
examine the usefulness of these coordination patterns for identifying the
activity of a disinformation campaign from other Twitter activity. We do this
by testing the proposed coordination patterns on a large-scale dataset of ten
state-attributed campaigns and various benign Twitter communities likely to
coordinate and share information amongst themselves. We show that such patterns
have significant limitations. First, coordination in Twitter communities is not
uncommon, especially when the online world is reacting to real-world news
(e.g., US impeachment trials). Second, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we found
that political bodies increased their coordinated activity. Such surge in
coordination worsens the trade-off between usability and rate of detection. To
identify most of the benign activity during the pandemic, the classifier misses
nearly 25% of disinformation activity. Conversely, if the classifier achieves a
high rate of detection for malicious coordination, it misclassifies 46% of
legitimate coordinated activity. In doing this meta-analysis, we show that
although coordination patterns could be useful for detecting disinformation
activity, further analysis is needed to determine the community's intention.

    <title>Stochastic Modeling of an Infectious Disease, Part I: Understand the
  Negative Binomial Distribution and Predict an Epidemic More Reliably</title>
    <summary>  Why are the epidemic patterns of COVID-19 so different among different cities
or countries which are similar in their populations, medical infrastructures,
and people's behavior? Why are forecasts or predictions made by so-called
experts often grossly wrong, concerning the numbers of people who get infected
or die? The purpose of this study is to better understand the stochastic nature
of an epidemic disease, and answer the above questions. Much of the work on
infectious diseases has been based on "SIR deterministic models," (Kermack and
McKendrick:1927.) We will explore stochastic models that can capture the
essence of the seemingly erratic behavior of an infectious disease. A
stochastic model, in its formulation, takes into account the random nature of
an infectious disease.
  The stochastic model we study here is based on the "birth-and-death process
with immigration" (BDI for short), which was proposed in the study of
population growth or extinction of some biological species. The BDI process
model ,however, has not been investigated by the epidemiology community. The
BDI process is one of a few birth-and-death processes, which we can solve
analytically. Its time-dependent probability distribution function is a
"negative binomial distribution" with its parameter $r$ less than $1$. The
"coefficient of variation" of the process is larger than $\sqrt{1/r} &gt; 1$.
Furthermore, it has a long tail like the zeta distribution. These properties
explain why infection patterns exhibit enormously large variations. The number
of infected predicted by a deterministic model is much greater than the median
of the distribution. This explains why any forecast based on a deterministic
model will fail more often than not.

    <title>Cross-Domain Segmentation with Adversarial Loss and Covariate Shift for
  Biomedical Imaging</title>
    <summary>  Despite the widespread use of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation
of images that are acquired from a single source, clinicians often use
multi-domain data for a detailed analysis. For instance, CT and MRI have
advantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output
characteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current
segmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to
their differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all
modalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore,
robustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training
step, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all
available data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods.
For this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can
learn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct
and shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift
property is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where
sparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is
used to perform cross-domain segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed
method is that no information related to modalities are provided in either
training or inference phase. The tests on CT and MRI liver data acquired in
routine clinical workflows show that the proposed model outperforms all other
baseline with a large margin. Experiments are also conducted on Covid-19
dataset that it consists of CT data where significant intra-class visual
differences are observed. Similarly, the proposed method achieves the best
performance.

    <title>Mind the GAP: Security &amp; Privacy Risks of Contact Tracing Apps</title>
    <summary>  Contact tracing apps running on mobile devices promise to reduce the manual
effort required for identifying infection chains and to increase the tracing
accuracy in the presence of COVID-19. Several contract tracing apps have been
proposed or deployed in practice. Also Google and Apple have announced their
joint effort of providing an API for exposure notification in order to
implement decentralized contract tracing apps using Bluetooth Low Energy, the
so-called "Google/Apple Proposal", which we abbreviate by "GAP". Some countries
have already decided or are planning to base their contact tracing apps on GAP.
Several researchers have pointed out potential privacy and security risks
related to most of the contact tracing approaches proposed until now, including
those that claim privacy protection and are based on GAP. This report makes a
first attempt towards providing empirical evidence in real-world scenarios for
two such risks discussed in the literature: one concerning privacy, and the
other one concerning security. In particular, we focus on a practical analysis
of GAP, given that it is the foundation of several tracing apps. We demonstrate
that in real-world scenarios the current GAP design is vulnerable to (i)
profiling and possibly de-anonymizing infected persons, and (ii) relay-based
wormhole attacks that principally can generate fake contacts with the potential
of significantly affecting the accuracy of an app-based contact tracing system.
For both types of attack, we have built tools that can be easily used on mobile
phones or Raspberry Pis (e.g., Bluetooth sniffers). We hope that our findings
provide valuable input in the process of testing and certifying contact tracing
apps, e.g., as planned for the German Corona-Warn-App, ultimately guiding
improvements for secure and privacy-preserving design and implementation of
digital contact tracing systems.

    <title>Carbon Monitor: a near-real-time daily dataset of global CO2 emission
  from fossil fuel and cement production</title>
    <summary>  We constructed a near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset, namely the Carbon
Monitor, to monitor the variations of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion
and cement production since January 1st 2019 at national level with near-global
coverage on a daily basis, with the potential to be frequently updated. Daily
CO2 emissions are estimated from a diverse range of activity data, including:
hourly to daily electrical power generation data of 29 countries, monthly
production data and production indices of industry processes of 62
countries/regions, daily mobility data and mobility indices of road
transportation of 416 cities worldwide. Individual flight location data and
monthly data were utilised for aviation and maritime transportation sectors
estimates. In addition, monthly fuel consumption data that corrected for daily
air temperature of 206 countries were used for estimating the emissions from
commercial and residential buildings. This Carbon Monitor dataset manifests the
dynamic nature of CO2 emissions through daily, weekly and seasonal variations
as influenced by workdays and holidays, as well as the unfolding impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Carbon Monitor near-real-time CO2 emission dataset shows
a 7.8% decline of CO2 emission globally from Jan 1st to Apr 30th in 2020 when
compared with the same period in 2019, and detects a re-growth of CO2 emissions
by late April which are mainly attributed to the recovery of economy activities
in China and partial easing of lockdowns in other countries. Further, this
daily updated CO2 emission dataset could offer a range of opportunities for
related scientific research and policy making.

    <title>Lio -- A Personal Robot Assistant for Human-Robot Interaction and Care
  Applications</title>
    <summary>  Lio is a mobile robot platform with a multi-functional arm explicitly
designed for human-robot interaction and personal care assistant tasks. The
robot has already been deployed in several health care facilities, where it is
functioning autonomously, assisting staff and patients on an everyday basis.
Lio is intrinsically safe by having full coverage in soft artificial-leather
material as well as having collision detection, limited speed and forces.
Furthermore, the robot has a compliant motion controller. A combination of
visual, audio, laser, ultrasound and mechanical sensors are used for safe
navigation and environment understanding. The ROS-enabled setup allows
researchers to access raw sensor data as well as have direct control of the
robot. The friendly appearance of Lio has resulted in the robot being well
accepted by health care staff and patients. Fully autonomous operation is made
possible by a flexible decision engine, autonomous navigation and automatic
recharging. Combined with time-scheduled task triggers, this allows Lio to
operate throughout the day, with a battery life of up to 8 hours and recharging
during idle times. A combination of powerful on-board computing units provides
enough processing power to deploy artificial intelligence and deep
learning-based solutions on-board the robot without the need to send any
sensitive data to cloud services, guaranteeing compliance with privacy
requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lio was rapidly adjusted to perform
additional functionality like disinfection and remote elevated body temperature
detection. It complies with ISO13482 - Safety requirements for personal care
robots, meaning it can be directly tested and deployed in care facilities.

    <title>Identifying the BLE Advertising Channel for Reliable Distance Estimation
  on Smartphones</title>
    <summary>  As a response to the global COVID-19 surge in 2020, many countries have
implemented lockdown or stay-at-home policies. If, however, the contact persons
of every infected patient could be identified, the number of virus
transmissions could be reduced, while the more incisive measures could be
softened. For this purpose, contact tracing using smartphones is being
considered as a promising technique. Here, smartphones emit and scan for
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals for detecting devices in range. When a
device is detected, its distance is estimated by evaluating its received signal
strength. The main insight that is exploited for distance estimation is that
the attenuation of a signal increases with the distance along which it has
traveled. However, besides distance, there are multiple additional factors that
impact the attenuation and hence disturb distance estimation. Among them,
frequency selective hardware and signal propagation belong to the most
significant ones. For example, a BLE device transmits beacons on three
different frequencies (channels), while the transmit power and the receiver
sensitivity depend on the frequency. As a result, the received signal strength
varies for each channel, even when the distance remains constant. However, the
information on which wireless channel a beacon has been received is not made
available to a smartphone. Hence, this error cannot be compensated, e.g., by
calibration. In this paper, we for the first time provide a solution to detect
the wireless channel on which a packet has been received on a smartphone. We
experimentally evaluate our proposed technique on multiple different smartphone
models. Our results help to make contact tracing more robust by improving the
accuracy of distance estimation.

    <title>Puff trains in speaking produce long-range turbulent jet-like transport
  potentially relevant to asymptomatic spreading of viruses</title>
    <summary>  Droplet generation and transport during coughing and sneezing has been
studied for decades to characterize disease transmission by symptomatic
individuals. Nevertheless, many reports document that asymptomatic and
presymptomatic individuals contribute to the spread of COVID-19, probably
during conversations in social interactions. Researchers have shown that
droplet emission occurs during speech, yet there are few quantitative studies
of the flows that provide the transport mechanism; the relevant fluid dynamics
is largely unstudied. This lack of quantitative characterization means that
when virus is present there is little public health guidance for understanding
risk and mitigation strategies, e.g. the "six-foot rule". Here we analyze flows
during breathing and speaking, including linguistic features, using
order-of-magnitudes estimates, numerical simulations, and laboratory
experiments. We show how plosive sounds like `P' are associated with vortical
structures, leading to rapid transport over half a meter in a split second.
When produced individually, puffs decay over a meter, with the distance
traveled in time $t$ scaling as $L\sim t^{1/4}$, and mix with the slower
environmental circulation. In contrast, the transport of exhaled material over
time scales longer than a few seconds, characteristic of speech, which is
effectively a train of puffs, is a conical turbulent jet with a scaling law
$L\sim t^{1/2}$. Typically, the exhaled air in front of a speaker extends 2 m
after 30 seconds of normal speech. We believe this work will inform thinking
about aerosol transport in disease transmission for humans and other animals,
and yield a better understanding of linguistic aerodynamics, i.e.,
aerolinguistics.
